<h2>I.</h2>

<p class="indent">Behind the pine grove the setting sun had left
a zone of fire against which the trunks of the pine
trees stood out like bronze columns. The path was
rugged and uneven, giving evidence of the ravages
wrought by the winter rains; at intervals loose stones,
looking like teeth detached from the gum, rendered
it still more impracticable. The melancholy shades
of twilight were beginning to envelop the landscape;
little by little the sunset glow faded away and the
moon, round and silvery, mounted in the heavens,
where the evening star was already shining. The
dismal croaking of the frogs fell sharply on the ear;
a fresh breeze stirred the dry plants and the dusty
brambles that grew by the roadside; and the trunks
of the pine trees grew momentarily blacker, standing
out like inky bars against the pale green of the
horizon.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page002" id="page002"></a>[pg&nbsp;002]</span>
A man was descending the path slowly, bent, apparently,
on enjoying the poetry and the peace of
the scene and the hour. He carried a stout walking-stick,
and as far as one could judge in the fading light,
he was young and not ill-looking.</p>

<p class="indent">He paused frequently, casting glances to the right
and to the left as if in search of some familiar landmark.
Finally he stood still and looked around him.
At his back was a hill crowned with chestnut trees;
on his left was the pine grove; on his right a small
church with a mean belfry; before him the outlying
houses of the town. He turned, walked back some
ten steps, stopped, fronting the portico of the
church, examined its walls, and, satisfied at last that
he had found the right place, raised his hands to his
mouth and forming with them a sort of speaking
trumpet, cried, in a clear youthful voice:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Echo, let us talk together!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">From the angle formed by the walls, there came
back instantly another voice, deeper and less distinct,
strangely grave and sonorous, which repeated with
emphasis, linking the answer to the question and
dwelling upon the final syllable:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Let us talk togethe-e-e-e-r!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Are you happy?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Happy-y-y-y!&quot; responded the echo.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page003" id="page003"></a>[pg&nbsp;003]</span>
&quot;Who am I?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I-I-I-I!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">To these interrogations, framed so that the answer
should make sense with them, succeeded phrases
uttered without any other object than that of hearing
them reverberated with strange intensity by the
wall. &quot;It is a lovely night.&quot;&mdash;&quot;The moon is shining.&quot;&mdash;&quot;The
sun has set.&quot;&mdash;&quot;Do you hear me,
echo?&quot;&mdash;&quot;Have you dreams, echo, of glory, ambition,
love?&quot; The traveler, enchanted with his occupation,
continued the conversation, varying the
words, combining them into sentences, and, in the
short intervals of silence, he listened to the faint
murmur of the pines stirred by the evening breeze,
and to the melancholy concert of the frogs. The
crimson and rose-colored clouds had become ashen
and had begun to invade the broad region of the
firmament over which the unclouded moon shed her
silvery light. The honeysuckles and elder-flowers
on the outskirts of the pine grove embalmed the air
with subtle and intoxicating fragrance. And the
interlocutor of the echo, yielding to the poetic influences
of the scene, ceased his questions and exclamations
and began to recite, in a slow, chanting voice,
verses of Becquer, paying no heed now to the
voice from the wall, which, in its haste to repeat
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page004" id="page004"></a>[pg&nbsp;004]</span>
his words, returned them to him broken and
confused.</p>

<p class="indent">Absorbed in his occupation, pleased with the harmonious
sounds of the verse, he did not notice
the approach of three men of odd and grotesque
appearance, wearing enormous broad-brimmed felt
hats. One of the men was leading a mule laden
with a leathern sack filled, doubtless, with the juice
of the grape; and as they walked slowly, and the
soft clayey soil deadened the noise of their footsteps,
they passed close by the young man, unperceived
by him. They exchanged some whispered words
with one another. &quot;Who is he, man?&quot;&mdash;&quot;Segundo.&quot;&mdash;&quot;The
lawyer&#39;s son?&quot;&mdash;&quot;The same.&quot;&mdash;&quot;What is he
doing? Is he talking to himself?&quot;&mdash;&quot;No, he is talking
to the wall of Santa Margarita.&quot;&mdash;&quot;Well, we have
as good a right to do that as he has.&quot;&mdash;&quot;Begin
you &mdash;&mdash;&quot;&mdash;&quot;One&mdash;two&mdash;here goes&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">And from those profane lips fell a shower of vile
words and coarse and vulgar phrases, interrupting
the <i>Oscuras Golondrinas</i> which the young man was
reciting with a great deal of expression, and producing,
in the peaceful and harmonious nocturnal
silence, the effect of the clatter of brass pans and
kettles in a piece of German music. The most
refined expressions were in the following style:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page005" id="page005"></a>[pg&nbsp;005]</span>
&quot;D&mdash;&mdash; (here an oath). Hurrah for the wine of the
Border! Hurrah for the red wine that gives courage
to man! D&mdash;&mdash;&quot; (the reader&#39;s imagination may
supply what followed, it being premised that the
disturbers of the Becquerian dreamer were three
lawless muleteers who were carrying with them an
abundant provision of the blood of the grape).</p>

<p class="indent">The nymph who dwelt in the wall opposed no
resistance to the profanation and repeated the round
oaths as faithfully as she had repeated the poet&#39;s
verses. Hearing the vociferations and bursts of
laughter which the wall sent back to him mockingly,
Segundo, the lawyer&#39;s son, aware that the barbarians
were turning his sentimental amusement into ridicule,
became enraged. Mortified and ashamed, he
tightened his grasp on his stick, strongly tempted to
break it on the ribs of some one of them; and, muttering
between his teeth, &quot;Kaffirs! brutes! beasts!&quot;
and other offensive epithets, he turned to the left,
plunged into the pine grove and walked toward the
town, avoiding the path in order to escape meeting
the profane trio.</p>

<p class="indent">The town was but a step away. The walls of its
nearest houses shone white in the moonlight, and the
stones of some buildings in course of erection, garden
walls, orchards, and vegetable beds, filled up the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page006" id="page006"></a>[pg&nbsp;006]</span>
space between the town and the pine grove. The
path grew gradually broader, until it reached the highroad,
on either side of which leafy chestnut trees cast
broad patches of shade. The town was already
asleep, seemingly, for not a light was to be seen, nor
were any of those noises to be heard which reveal
the proximity of those human beehives called cities.
Vilamorta is in reality a very small beehive, a modest
town, the capital of a district. Bathed in the
splendor of the romantic satellite, however, it was
not without a certain air of importance imparted to
it by the new buildings, of a style of architecture
peculiar to prison cells, which an <i>Americanized</i>
Galician, recently returned to his native land with a
plentiful supply of cash, was erecting with all possible
expedition.</p>

<p class="indent">Segundo turned into an out-of-the-way street&mdash;if
there be any such in towns like Vilamorta. Only
the sidewalks were paved; the gutter was a gutter in
reality; it was full of muddy pools and heaps of
kitchen garbage, thrown there without scruple by
the inhabitants. Segundo avoided two things&mdash;stepping
into the gutter and walking in the moonlight.
A man passed so close by him as almost to touch
him, enveloped, notwithstanding the heat, in an ample
cloak, and holding open above his head an enormous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page007" id="page007"></a>[pg&nbsp;007]</span>
umbrella, although there was no sign of rain;
doubtless he was some convalescent, some visitor to
the springs, who was breathing the pleasant night
air with hygienic precautions. Segundo, when he
saw him, walked closer to the houses, turning his
face aside as if afraid of being recognized. With
no less caution he crossed the Plaza del Consistorio,
the pride of Vilamorta, and then, instead of joining
one of the groups who were enjoying the fresh air,
seated on the stone benches round the public fountain,
he slipped into a narrow side street, and crossing
a retired little square shaded by a gigantic poplar
turned his steps in the direction of a small house
half hidden in the shadow of the tree. Between the
house and Segundo there stood a lumbering bulk&mdash;the
body of a stage-coach, a large box on wheels, its
shafts raised in air, waiting, lance in rest, as it were,
to renew the attack. Segundo skirted the obstacle,
and as he turned the corner of the square, absorbed
in his meditations, two immense hogs, monstrously
fat, rushed out of the half-open gate of a neighboring
yard, and at a short trot that made their
enormous sides shake like jelly, made straight for
the admirer of Becquer, entangling themselves stupidly
and blindly between his legs. By a special
interposition of Providence the young man did not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page008" id="page008"></a>[pg&nbsp;008]</span>
measure his length upon the ground, but, his patience
now exhausted, he gave each of the swine a
couple of angry kicks, which drew from them sharp
and ferocious grunts, as he ejaculated almost audibly:
&quot;What a town is this, good Heavens! Even
the hogs must run against one in the streets. Ah,
what a miserable place! Hell itself could not be
worse!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">By the time he had reached the door of the house,
he had, to some extent, regained his composure.
The house was small and pretty and had a cheerful
air. There was no railing outside the windows, only
the stone ledges, which were covered with plants in
pots and boxes; through the windows shaded by
muslin curtains a light could be seen burning, and in
the silent fa&ccedil;ade there was something peaceful and
attractive that invited one to enter. Segundo
pushed open the door and almost at the same instant
there was heard in the dark hall the rustling of
skirts, a woman&#39;s arms were opened and the admirer
of Becquer, throwing himself into them, allowed himself
to be led, dragged, carried bodily, almost, up
the stairs, and into the little parlor where, on a table
covered with a white crochet cover, burned a carefully
trimmed lamp. There, on the sofa, the lover
and the lady seated themselves.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page009" id="page009"></a>[pg&nbsp;009]</span>
Truth before all things. The lady was not far from
thirty-six or thirty-seven, and what is worse, could
never have been pretty, or even passably good-looking.
The smallpox had pitted and hardened
her coarse skin, giving it the appearance of the
leather bottom of a sieve. Her small black eyes,
hard and bright like two fleas, matched well her
nose, which was thick and ill-shaped, like the noses of
the figures of lay monks stamped on chocolate.
True, the mouth was fresh-colored, the teeth white
and sound like those of a dog; but everything else
pertaining to her&mdash;dress, manner, accent, the want
of grace of the whole&mdash;was calculated rather to put
tender thoughts to flight than to awaken them.
With the lamp shining as brightly as it does, it is
preferable to contemplate the lover. The latter is
of medium height, has a graceful, well-proportioned
figure, and in the turn of his head and in his youthful
features there is something that irresistibly attracts
and holds the gaze. His forehead, which is
high and straight, is shaded and set off by luxuriant
hair, worn somewhat longer than is allowed by our
present severe fashion. His face, thin and delicately
outlined, casts a shadow on the walls which is made
up of acute angles. A mustache, curling with the
grace which is peculiar to a first mustache, and to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page010" id="page010"></a>[pg&nbsp;010]</span>
the wavy locks of a young girl, shades but does not
cover his upper lip. The beard has not yet attained
its full growth; the muscles of the throat have not
yet become prominent; the Adam&#39;s apple does not
yet force itself on the attention. The complexion is
dark, pale, and of a slightly bilious hue.</p>

<p class="indent">Seeing this handsome youth leaning his head on
the shoulder of this woman of mature age and undisguised
ugliness, it would have been natural to
take them for mother and son, but anyone coming
to this conclusion, after a single moment&#39;s observation,
would have shown scant penetration, for
in the manifestations of maternal affection, however
passionate and tender they may be, there
is always a something of dignity and repose
which is wanting in those of every other
affection.</p>

<p class="indent">Doubtless Segundo felt a longing to see the moon
again, for he rose almost immediately from his seat
on the sofa and crossed over to the window, his companion
following him. He threw open the sash, and
they sat down side by side in two low chairs whose
seats were on a level with the flower-pots. A fine
carnation regaled the sense with its intoxicating
perfume; the moon lighted up with her silvery rays
the foliage of the poplar that cast broad shadow
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page011" id="page011"></a>[pg&nbsp;011]</span>
over the little square. Segundo opened the conversation
this wise:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Have you made any cigars for me?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Here are some,&quot; she answered, putting her hand
into her pocket and drawing from it a bundle of
cigars. &quot;I was able to make only a dozen and a half
for you. I will complete the two dozen to-night
before I go to bed.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">There was a moment&#39;s silence, broken by the
sharp sound made by the striking of the match and
then, in a voice muffled by the first puff of smoke,
Segundo went on:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why, has anything new happened?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;New? No. The children&mdash;putting the house
in order&mdash;and then&mdash;Minguitos. He made my head
ache with his complaining&mdash;he complained the whole
blessed evening. He said his bones ached. And
you? Very busy, killing yourself reading, studying,
writing, eh? Of course!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, I have been taking a delightful walk. I
went to Pe&ntilde;as-albas and returned by way of Santa
Margarita. I have seldom spent a pleasanter evening.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I warrant you were making verses.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, my dear. The verses I made I made last
night after leaving you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page012" id="page012"></a>[pg&nbsp;012]</span>
&quot;Ah! And you weren&#39;t going to repeat them to
me. Come, for the love of the saints, come, recite
them for me, you must know them by heart. Come,
darling.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">To this vehement entreaty succeeded a passionate
kiss, pressed on the hair and forehead of the poet.
The latter raised his eyes, drew back a little and,
holding his cigar between his fingers after knocking
off the ashes with his nail, proceeded to recite.</p>

<p class="indent">The offspring of his muse was a poem in imitation
of Becquer. His auditor, who listened to it with
religious attention, thought it superior to anything
inspired by the muse of the great Gustave. And
she asked for another and then another, and then a
bit of Espronceda and then a fragment or two of
Zorrilla. By this time the cigar had gone out; the
poet threw away the stump and lighted a fresh one.
Then they resumed their conversation.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Shall we have supper soon?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Directly. What do you think I have for you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I haven&#39;t the least idea.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Think of what you like best. What you like
best, better than anything else.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Bah! You know that so far as I am concerned,
provided you don&#39;t give me anything smoked or
greasy&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page013" id="page013"></a>[pg&nbsp;013]</span>
&quot;A French omelet! You couldn&#39;t guess, eh?
Let me tell you&mdash;I found the receipt in a book. As
I had heard that it was something good I wanted to
try it. I had always made omelets as they make
them here, so stiff, that you might throw one against
the wall without breaking it. But this&mdash;I think it
will be to your taste. As for me, I don&#39;t like it
much, I prefer the old style. I showed Flores how
to make it. What was in the one you ate at the
inn at Orense? Chopped parsley, eh?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, ham. But what difference does it make
what was in it?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;ll run and take it out of the pantry! I thought&mdash;the
book says parsley! Wait, wait.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She overturned her chair in her haste. An instant
later the jingling of her keys and the opening and
closing of a couple of doors were heard in the distance.
A husky voice muttered some unintelligible
words in the kitchen. In two minutes she was back
again.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Tell me, and those verses, are you not going to
publish them? Am I not going to see them in
print?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes,&quot; responded the poet, slowly turning his
head to one side and sending a puff of smoke
through his lips. &quot;I am going to send them to Vigo,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page014" id="page014"></a>[pg&nbsp;014]</span>
to Roberto Blanquez, to insert them in the
<i>Amanecer</i>.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am delighted! You will become famous,
sweetheart! How many periodicals have spoken of
you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Segundo laughed ironically and shrugged his
shoulders.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Not many.&quot; And with a somewhat preoccupied
air he let his gaze wander over the plants and far
away over the top of the poplar whose leaves rustled
gently in the breeze. The poet pressed his companion&#39;s
hand mechanically, and the latter returned
the pressure with passionate ardor.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Of course. How do you expect them to speak
of you when you don&#39;t put your name to your
verses?&quot; she said. &quot;They don&#39;t know whose they
are. They are wondering, likely&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What difference does the name make? They
could say the same things of the pseudonym I have
adopted as of Segundo Garc&iacute;a. The few people
who will trouble themselves to read my verses will
call me the Swan of Vilamorta.&quot;</p>

<h2>II.</h2>

<p class="indent">Segundo Garc&iacute;a, the lawyer&#39;s son, and Leocadia
Otero, the schoolmistress of Vilamorta, had met each
other for the first time in the spring at a pilgrimage.
Leocadia had gone with some girls to whom she had
taught their letters and plain sewing. Before the
chorus of nymphs Segundo had recited verses for
more than two hours in an oak grove far from the
noise of the drum and the bagpipes, where the
strains of the music and the voices of the crowd
came softened by distance. The audience was as
silent as if they were hearing mass, although certain
passages of a tender or passionate nature were the
occasion, among the children, of nudges, pinches,
laughter instantaneously suppressed; but from the
black eyes of the schoolmistress, down her cheeks,
pitted by the smallpox and pale with emotion,
flowed two large, warm tears, followed so quickly
and in such abundance by others that she was
obliged to take out her handkerchief to wipe them
away. And returning by starlight, descending the
mountain on whose summit stood the sanctuary, by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page016" id="page016"></a>[pg&nbsp;016]</span>
sylvan footpaths carpeted with grass and bordered
with heather and briars, the order of march was as
follows: first the children, running, jumping, pushing
one another among the heather and greeting
every fall with shouts of laughter; Leocadia and
Segundo behind, arm-in-arm, pausing from time to
time to talk in subdued tones, almost in whispers.</p>

<p class="indent">A sad and ugly story was told about Leocadia
Otero. Although, without actually saying so, she
had given it to be understood that she was a widow,
it was whispered that she had never been married;
that the puny Dominguito, the little cripple who
was always sick, was born while she lived in the
house of her uncle and guardian at Orense, after the
death of her parents. What was certain was that
her uncle had died shortly after the birth of the
child, bequeathing to his niece a couple of fields
and a house in Vilamorta, and Leocadia, after passing
the necessary examinations, had obtained the
village school and gone to settle in that town. She
had lived in it now for more than thirteen years,
observing the most exemplary conduct, watching day
and night over Minguitos, and living with the utmost
frugality in order to rebuild the dilapidated house,
which she had finally succeeded in doing shortly
before her meeting with Segundo. Leocadia was a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page017" id="page017"></a>[pg&nbsp;017]</span>
woman of notably industrious habits; in her wardrobe
she had always a good supply of linen, in her
parlor bamboo furniture with a rug before the sofa,
grapes, rice, and ham in her pantry, and carnations
and sweet basil in her windows. Minguitos was
always as neat as a new pin; she herself, when she
raised the skirt of her habit of Dolores, of good
merino, displayed underneath voluminous embroidered
petticoats, stiff with starch. For all which
reasons, notwithstanding her ugliness and her former
history, the schoolmistress was not without suitors&mdash;a
wealthy retired muleteer, and Cansin, the clothier.
She rejected the suitors and continued living alone
with Minguitos and Flores, her old servant, who
now enjoyed in the house all the privileges of a
grandmother.</p>

<p class="indent">The iniquitous wrong suffered by her in early
youth had produced in Leocadia, absorbed as she
was in her bitter recollections, a profound horror of
marriage and an insatiable thirst for the romantic,
the ideal, which is as a refreshing dew to the imagination
and which satisfies the emotions. She had the
superficial knowledge of a village schoolmistress&mdash;rudimentary,
but sufficient to introduce exotic tastes
into Vilamorta; that is to say, a taste for literature in
its most accessible forms&mdash;novels and poetry. She
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page018" id="page018"></a>[pg&nbsp;018]</span>
devoted to reading the leisure hours of her monotonous
and upright life. She read with faith, with
enthusiasm, uncritically; she read believing and accepting
everything, identifying herself with each one
of the heroines, in turn, her heart echoing back the
poet&#39;s sighs, the troubadour&#39;s songs, and the laments
of the bard. Reading was her one vice, her secret
happiness. When she requested her friends at
Orense to renew her subscription to the library for
her they laughed at her and nicknamed her the
&quot;Authoress.&quot; She an authoress! She only wished
she were. If she could only give form to what she
felt, to the world of fancy she carried in her mind!
But this was impossible. Never would her brain
succeed in producing, however hard she might
squeeze it, even so much as a poor <i>seguidilla</i>.
Poetry and sensibility were stored up in the folds
and convolutions of her brain, as solar heat is stored
up in the coal. What came to the surface was pure
prose&mdash;housekeeping, economy, stews.</p>

<p class="indent">When she met Segundo, chance applied the lighted
torch to the formidable train of feelings and dreams
shut up in the soul of the schoolmistress. She had
at last found a worthy employment for her amorous
faculties, an outlet for her affections. Segundo was
poetry incarnate. He represented for her all the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page019" id="page019"></a>[pg&nbsp;019]</span>
graces, all the divine attributes of poetry&mdash;the flowers,
the breeze, the nightingale, the dying light of
day, the moon, the dark wood.</p>

<p class="indent">The fire burned with astounding rapidity. In its
flames were consumed, first her honorable resolution
to efface by the blamelessness of her conduct the
stigma of the past, then her strong and deep maternal
affection. Not for an instant did the thought present
itself to Leocadia&#39;s mind that Segundo could
ever be her husband; although both were free the
difference in their ages and the intellectual superiority
of the young poet placed an insurmountable barrier
in the way of the aspirations of the schoolmistress.
She fell in love as into an abyss, and looked
neither before nor behind.</p>

<p class="indent">Segundo had had in Santiago, during his college
days, youthful intrigues, adventures of a not very
serious nature, such as few men escape between the
ages of fifteen and twenty-five, occasionally taking
part, also, in what in that romantic epoch were
called <i>orgies</i>. Notwithstanding all this, however,
he was not vicious. The son of a hysterical mother,
whose strength was exhausted by repeated lactations,
and who at last succumbed to the debility induced
by them, Segundo&#39;s spirit was much more
exacting and insatiable than his body. He had inherited
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page020" id="page020"></a>[pg&nbsp;020]</span>
from his mother a melancholy temperament
and innumerable prejudices, innumerable instinctive
antipathies, innumerable superstitious practices. He
had loved her, and he cherished her memory with
veneration. And more tenacious even than his loving
remembrance of his mother was the invincible
antipathy he cherished for his father. It would not
be true to say that the lawyer had been the murderer
of his wife, and yet Segundo clearly divined the
slow martyrdom endured by that fine nervous organization,
and had always before his eyes, in his hours
of gloom, the mean coffin in which the dead woman
was interred, shrouded in the oldest sheet that was to
be found.</p>

<p class="indent">Segundo&#39;s family consisted of his father, an aunt,
advanced in years, two brothers, and three sisters.
The lawyer Garc&iacute;a enjoyed the reputation of being
wealthy&mdash;in reality this fortune was insignificant&mdash;a
village fortune accumulated penny by penny, by
usurious loans and innumerable sordid privations.
His practice brought him in something, but ten
mouths to feed and the professional education of
three sons swallowed up not a little. The eldest of
the boys, an officer in an infantry regiment, was stationed
in the Philippine Islands, and, far from expecting
any money from him, they were thankful if he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page021" id="page021"></a>[pg&nbsp;021]</span>
did not ask for any. Segundo, the second in age as
well as in name, had just been graduated&mdash;one lawyer
more in Spain, where this fruit grows so abundantly.
The youngest was studying at the Institute
at Orense, with the intention of becoming an
apothecary. The girls spent the days running about
in the gardens and cornfields, half the time barefooted,
not even attending Leocadia&#39;s school to save
the slight expense that would be incurred in procuring
the decent clothing which this would necessitate.
As for the aunt&mdash;Mis&iacute;a G&aacute;spara&mdash;she was the soul
of the house, a narrow and sapless soul, a withered
old woman, silent and ghost-like in appearance, still
active, in spite of her sixty years, who, without ceasing
to knit her stockings with fingers as yellow as
the keys of an old harpsichord, sold barley in the
granary, wine in the cellar, lent a dollar at fifty per
cent. interest to the fruit-women and hucksters of
the market, receiving their wares in payment, measured
out the food, the light, and their clothing to her
nieces, fattened a pig with affectionate solicitude,
and was respected in Vilamorta for her ant-like
abilities.</p>

<p class="indent">It was the lawyer&#39;s aspiration to transmit his practice
and his office to Segundo. Only the boy gave
no indication of an aptitude for stirring up law-suits
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page022" id="page022"></a>[pg&nbsp;022]</span>
and prosecutions. How had he achieved the miracle
of passing with honor in the examinations without
ever having opened a law-book during the whole
term, and failing in attendance at the college whenever
it rained or whenever the sun shone? Well, by
means of an excellent memory and a good natural
intelligence; learning by heart, when it was necessary,
whole pages from the text-books, and remembering
and reciting them with the same ease, if not
with as much taste, as he recited the &quot;Doloras&quot; of
Campoamor.</p>

<p class="indent">On Segundo&#39;s table lay, side by side, the works of
Zorrilla and Espronceda, bad translations of Heine,
books of verse of local poets, the &quot;Lamas-Varela,&quot; or,
<i>Antidote to Idleness</i>, and other volumes of a no less
heterogeneous kind. Segundo was not an insatiable
reader; he chose his reading according to the whim
of the moment, and he read only what was in conformity
with his tastes, thus acquiring a superficial
culture of an imperfect and varied nature. Quick of
apprehension, rather than thoughtful or studious, he
had learned French without a teacher and almost by
intuition, in order to read in the original the works
of Musset, Lamartine, Proudhon, and Victor Hugo.
His mind was like an uncultivated field in which
grew here and there some rare and beautiful flower,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page023" id="page023"></a>[pg&nbsp;023]</span>
some exotic plant; of the abstruse and positive
sciences, of solid and serious learning, which is the
nurse of mental vigor&mdash;the classics, the best literature,
the severe teachings of history&mdash;he knew nothing;
and in exchange, by a singular phenomenon of
intellectual relationship, he identified himself with
the romantic movement of the second third of the
century, and in a remote corner of Galicia lived
again the psychological life of dead and gone generations.
So does some venerable academician, over-leaping
the nineteen centuries of our era, delight
himself now with what delighted Horace and
live platonically enamored of Lydia.</p>

<p class="indent">Segundo composed his first verses, cynical and
pessimistic in intention, ingenuous in reality, before
he had reached the age of seventeen. His classmates
applauded him to the echo. He acquired in
their eyes a certain prestige, and when the first fruits
of his muse appeared in a periodical he had, without
going beyond the narrow circle of the college, admirers
and detractors. Thenceforth he acquired the right
to indulge in solitary walks, to laugh rarely, to surround
his adventures with mystery, and not to play
or take a drink for good-fellowship&#39;s sake except
when he felt in the humor.</p>

<p class="indent">And he seldom felt in the humor. Excitation of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page024" id="page024"></a>[pg&nbsp;024]</span>
the senses, of a purely physical nature, possessed no
attraction for him; if he drank at times through
bravado, the spectacle of drunkenness, the winding-up
of student orgies&mdash;the soiled tablecloth, the
maudlin disputes, his companions lying under the
table or stretched on the sofa, the shamelessness
and heartlessness of venal women&mdash;repelled him and
he came away from such scenes filled with disgust
and contempt, and at times a reaction proper to his
complex character sent him, a sincere admirer of
Proudhon, Quinet, and Renan, to the precincts of
some solitary church, where he drew in with delight
long breaths of the incense-laden air.</p>

<p class="indent">The lawyer Garc&iacute;a made no protest against his
son&#39;s literary inclinations because he regarded them
as a passing amusement proper to his age, a youthful
folly, like dancing at a village feast. He began
to grow uneasy when he saw that Segundo, after
graduation, showed no inclination to help him in the
conduct of his tortuous law-suits. Was the boy,
then, going to turn out good for nothing but to
string rhymes together? It was no crime to do this,
but&mdash;when there was not a pile of law-papers to go
through and stratagems to think of to circumvent
the opposing party. Since the lawyer had observed
this inclination of his son he had treated him with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page025" id="page025"></a>[pg&nbsp;025]</span>
more persistent harshness and coldness than before.
Every day at table or whenever the occasion offered,
he made cutting speeches to him about the necessity
of earning one&#39;s own bread by assiduous labor,
instead of depending upon others for it. These continual
sermons, in which he displayed the same captious
and harassing obstinacy as in the conduct of
his law-suits, frightened Segundo from the house. In
Leocadia&#39;s house he found a place of refuge, and he
submitted passively to be adored; flattered in the
first place by the triumph his verses had obtained,
awakening admiration so evidently sincere and ardent,
and in the second place attracted by the moral
well-being engendered by unquestioning approval
and unmeasured complacency. His idle, dreamy
brain reposed on the soft cushions which affection
smoothes for the beloved head; Leocadia sympathized
with all his plans for the future, developing
and enlarging them; she encouraged him to write
and to publish his verses; she praised him without
reserve and without hypocrisy, for, for her, whose
critical faculty was situated in her cardiac cavities,
Segundo was the most melodious singer in the universe.</p>

<p class="indent">Gradually the loving prevision of the schoolmistress
extended to other departments of Segundo&#39;s
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page026" id="page026"></a>[pg&nbsp;026]</span>
existence. Neither the lawyer Garc&iacute;a nor Aunt
G&aacute;spara supposed that a young man, once his education
was finished, needed a penny for any extraordinary
expense. Aunt G&aacute;spara, in particular, protested
loudly at every fresh outlay&mdash;after filling her
nephew&#39;s trunk one year she thought he was provided
with shirts for at least ten years to come:
clothes had no right to tear or to wear out, without
any consideration, in that way. Leocadia took note
of the wants of her idol; one day she observed that
he was not well supplied with handkerchiefs and she
hemmed and marked a dozen for him; the next day
she noticed that he was expected to keep himself in
cigars for a year on half a dollar, and she took upon
herself the task of making them for him, furnishing
the material herself gratis. She heard the fruit-women
criticising Aunt G&aacute;spara&#39;s stinginess; she
inferred from this that Segundo had a poor table,
and she set herself to the task of devising appetizing
and nutritious dishes for him; in addition to all
which she ordered books from Orense, mended his
clothes, and sewed on his buttons.</p>

<p class="indent">All this she did with inexpressible delight, going
about the house with a light, almost youthful step,
rejuvenated by the sweet maternity of love, and so
happy that she forgot to scold the school-children,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page027" id="page027"></a>[pg&nbsp;027]</span>
thinking only of shortening their tasks that she
might be all the sooner with Segundo. There was
in her affection much that was generous and spiritual,
and her happiest moments were those in which, as
they sat side by side at the window, his head resting
on her shoulder, she listened, while her imagination
transformed the pots of carnations and sweet basil
into a virgin forest, to the verses which he recited
in a well-modulated voice, verses that seemed to
Leocadia celestial music.</p>

<p class="indent">The medal had its obverse side, however. The
mornings were full of bitterness when Flores would
come with an angry and frowning face, her woolen
shawl twisted and wrinkled and falling over her eyes,
to say in short, abrupt phrases:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The eggs are all used; shall I get more? There
is no sugar; which kind shall I buy&mdash;that dear loaf
sugar that we bought last week? To-day I got coffee,
two pounds of coffee, as if we had a gold mine.
I won&#39;t buy any more cordial&mdash;you can go for it
yourself&mdash;I won&#39;t.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What are you talking about, Flores? What is
the matter with you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I say that if you like to give Ramon, the confectioner,
twenty-four reals a bottle for <i>anisette</i>, when
it is to be had for eight at the apothecary&#39;s, you can
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page028" id="page028"></a>[pg&nbsp;028]</span>
do so, but that I am not going to put the money in
that thief&#39;s hand; he will be asking you five dollars
a bottle for it next.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Leocadia would come out of her reverie with a
sigh, and go to the bureau drawer for the money,
not without thinking that Flores was only too right;
her savings, her couple of thousand reals laid by for
an emergency, must be almost gone; it was better
not to examine into the condition of the purse; better
put off annoyances as long as possible. God
would provide. And she would scold the old
woman with feigned anger.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Go for the bottle; go&mdash;and don&#39;t make me
angry. At eight the children will be here and I have
my petticoat to iron yet. Make Minguitos his chocolate;
you would be better employed in seeing that
he has something to eat. And give him some cake.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes. I&#39;ll give him some, I&#39;ll give him some. If
I didn&#39;t give the poor child something&mdash;&mdash;&quot; grumbled
the servant, who at Minguitos&#39; name felt her anger
increase. In the kitchen could be heard the furious
knock given to the chocolate-pot to settle it on the
fire and the angry sound of the mill, afterward, beating
the chocolate into froth. Flores would enter
the room of the deformed boy, who had not yet left
his bed, and taking his hand in hers, say:</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page029" id="page029"></a>[pg&nbsp;029]</span>
&quot;Are you warm, child? I have brought you your
chocolate; do you hear?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Will mamma give it to me?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I will give it to you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And mamma&mdash;what is she doing?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ironing some petticoats.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The little humpback would fix his eyes on Flores,
raising his head with difficulty from between the
double arch of the breast and back. His eyes were
deep set, with large pupils; on his mouth, with its
prominent jaws, rested a melancholy and distorted
smile. Throwing his arms around the neck of Flores,
and putting his lips close to her ear:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Did the <i>other one</i> come yesterday?&quot; he asked.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, child, yes.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Will he come again to-day?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He&#39;ll come. Of course he&#39;ll come! Stop talking,
<i>fillino</i>, stop talking and take your chocolate.
It&#39;s as you like it&mdash;thin and with froth.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don&#39;t think I have any appetite for it. Put it
there beside me.&quot;</p>


<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page030" id="page030"></a>[pg&nbsp;030]</span></p>

<h2>III.</h2>

<p class="indent">In Vilamorta there was a Casino, a real Casino,
small indeed, and shabby, besides, but with its
billiard-table, bought at second-hand, and its <i>boy</i>, an
old man of seventy, who once a year dusted and
brushed the green cover. For the only reunions in
the Casino of Vilamorta were those of the rats and
the moths who assembled daily, to amuse themselves
by eating away the woodwork. The chief
centers of reunion were the two apothecaries&#39; shops,
that of Do&ntilde;a Eufrasia, fronting the Plaza and that
of Agonde in the high street. Do&ntilde;a Eufrasia&#39;s
shop, nestling in the shadowy corner of an archway,
was dark; in the hours of meeting it was lighted by
a smoky kerosene lamp; its furniture consisted of
four grimy chairs and a bench.</p>

<p class="indent">From the street all that was to be seen were dark
mass-cloaks, overcoats, broad-brimmed hats, two or
three clerical tonsures that shone at a distance like
metal clasps against the dark background of the shop.
Agonde&#39;s shop, on the contrary, was brightly illuminated
and gloried in the possession of six glass globes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page031" id="page031"></a>[pg&nbsp;031]</span>
of brilliant coloring and fantastic effect, three rows
of shelves laden with imposing and scientific-looking
white porcelain jars bearing Latin inscriptions in
black letters, a divan, and two leather-covered armchairs.
The two contrasting shops were also antagonistic;
they had declared war to the knife against
each other.</p>

<p class="indent">Agonde&#39;s shop, liberal and enlightened in its opinions,
said of the reactionary shop that it was a center
of unending conspiracies, where <i>El Cuartel Real</i>
and all the rebel proclamations had been read during
the civil war, and where for the past five years ammunition-belts
were being diligently prepared for a
Carlist party that never took the field; and according
to the reactionary shop, that of Agonde was the
headquarters of the Freemasons; where lampoons
were printed on a little handpress and where gambling
was shamelessly carried on. The meetings in
the reactionary shop broke up with religious punctuality
at ten, in winter, and eleven in summer, while
the liberal shop continued to cast on the sidewalk
until midnight the light of its two bright lamps and
the blue, red, and emerald-green reflections of its glass
globes; for which reasons the members of the liberal
reunion called those of the other party <i>owls</i>, while
those of the reactionary clique gave their opponents
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page032" id="page032"></a>[pg&nbsp;032]</span>
the name of <i>members of the Casino of the Gaming
Table</i>.</p>

<p class="indent">Segundo never put his foot over the threshold of
the reactionary shop and, since the beginning of his
acquaintance with Leocadia Otero, he had shunned
that of Agonde also, for his vanity was wounded by
the jests and gibes of the apothecary, who was noted
for his waggish humor. One evening as Saturnino
Agonde was crossing the Plaza of the Alamo at an
unusually late hour&mdash;on his way the devil only knew
whither&mdash;he had caught sight of Leocadia and
Segundo seated at the window, and had heard the
psalmody of the verses which the poet was declaiming.
From that time Segundo had seen depicted on
the countenance of Agonde, a practical man of a
sanguine temperament, such contempt for sentimental
trifling and for poetry that he instinctively
avoided him as far as it was possible to do so. Occasionally,
however, whenever he desired to read <i>El
Imparcial</i>, to know what was going on, he would
stop in at the shop for a few moments. He did so
on the day after his conversation with the echo.</p>

<p class="indent">The meeting was very animated. Segundo&#39;s
father was leaning back on the sofa with a newspaper
resting on his knees; his brother-in-law, the
notary Genday, Ramon, the confectioner, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page033" id="page033"></a>[pg&nbsp;033]</span>
Agonde were hotly disputing with him. At the
further end of the shop Carmelo, the tobacconist,
Don Fermin, alias <i>Tropiezo</i>,<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> the physician, the secretary
of the Municipality and the Alcalde sat playing
<i>tresillo</i> at a small table. When Segundo entered, he
remarked something unusual in the air of his father
and of the group that surrounded him, but certain
that he would presently be told the cause, he
silently dropped into an armchair, lighted a cigar,
and took up the copy of <i>El Imparcial</i> that was
lying on the counter.</p>

<div class="footnotes">
<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_1_1" id="Footnote_1_1"></a>
<a href="#FNanchor_1_1">
<span class="label">[1]</span></a>
Trip.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, the papers here say nothing, absolutely
nothing, about it,&quot; exclaimed the confectioner.</p>

<p class="indent">From the tresillo table came the voice of the doctor
confirming Ramon&#39;s doubts; the doctor, too, was
of the opinion that the event in question could not
happen without due notice of it being given in the
papers.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You would die rather than believe anything,&quot;
replied Agonde. &quot;I am certain of it, I tell you, and
it seems to me that when I am certain of it&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And I too,&quot; affirmed Genday. &quot;If it is necessary
to call witnesses to prove it, they are there. I know
it from my own brother, who heard it from Mendez
de las Vides; you can judge whether I have the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page034" id="page034"></a>[pg&nbsp;034]</span>
news on good authority or not. Do you want further
proof? Well, two armchairs, a handsome gilt
bedstead, a great deal of china and a piano have
been ordered from Orense for Las Vides. Are you
convinced?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;In any case they will not come as soon as you
say,&quot; objected Tropiezo.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;They will come at the time I have said. Don
Victoriano wants to spend the holidays and the vintage
season here; they say he longs to see his native
place again, and that he has spoken of nothing
all the winter but the journey.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He is coming to die here,&quot; said Tropiezo; &quot;I
heard that he was in a very bad state of health.
You are going to be left without a leader.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Go to&mdash;&mdash;What a devil of a man, what an owl,
always predicting misfortunes! Either hold your
tongue, or talk sense. Attend to the game, as you
ought to.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Segundo was gazing abstractedly at the glass
globes of the shop, his attention seemingly occupied
with the blue, green, and red points of light that
sparkled in their center. He understood now the
subject of their conversation&mdash;the expected arrival
of Don Victoriano Andres de la Comba, the minister,
the great political leader of the country, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page035" id="page035"></a>[pg&nbsp;035]</span>
radical representative of the district. What mattered
to Segundo the arrival of this pretentious
coxcomb! And giving himself up to the enjoyment
of his cigar, he allowed the noisy dispute to go on
unheeded. Afterward he became absorbed in the
reading of an article in <i>El Imparcial</i>, in which a new
poet was warmly eulogized.</p>

<p class="indent">Meanwhile at the tresillo table matters were becoming
complicated. The apothecary, who sat
behind the Alcalde, was giving him advice&mdash;a delicate
and difficult task.</p>

<p class="indent">The tobacconist and Don Fermin held all the
good cards; they had the man between them&mdash;a
ticklish position. The Alcalde was a thin shriveled-up
old man, of a very timid disposition, who, before
he ventured to play a card, would think a hundred
years about it, calculating all the contingencies
and all the possible combinations of which cards are
capable. He did not want now to play that <i>solo</i>. It
would be a great mistake! But the impetuous
Agonde encouraged him, saying: &quot;Come! I buy it.&quot;
Thus urged, the Alcalde came to a decision, but not
without having first entered a protest:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Very well, I&#39;ll play it, but it is a piece of folly,
gentlemen&mdash;so that you may not say I am afraid.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">And all that he had foreseen happened; he found
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page036" id="page036"></a>[pg&nbsp;036]</span>
himself between two fires: on the one side his king
of hearts is trumped, on the other his opponent
takes his knave of trumps with his queen. Don
Fermin wins the trick without knowing how, while
the tobacconist, who is smiling maliciously, keeps all
his good cards. The Alcalde lifts his eyes appealingly
to Agonde.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Didn&#39;t I tell you so? A nice fix we have got
ourselves into! We shall lose the hand; it is lost
already.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, man, no. What a coward you are&mdash;always
afraid of everything. There you are hesitating as
long about throwing a card as if your life depended
on it. Play a trump! play a trump! That is the
way cowards always lose&mdash;they are afraid to play
their trumps.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The opponents winked at each other maliciously.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;<i>De posita non tibi</i>,&quot; exclaimed the tobacconist.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;<i>Si codillum non resultabit</i>,&quot; assented Don
Fermin.</p>

<p class="indent">The Alcalde, quaking with fear, proceeded, by
Agonde&#39;s advice, to look through the tricks his
partners had taken, in order to see how many trumps
had been already played. Tropiezo and the tobacconist
protested:</p>

<p class="indent">What a mania he had for examining the cards!</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page037" id="page037"></a>[pg&nbsp;037]</span>
The Alcalde, somewhat tranquillized, resolved at
last to put an end to his uncertainty, and with a few
bold and decisive plays the hand ended, each player
winning three tricks.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;A tie!&quot; exclaimed the tobacconist and the
apothecary almost simultaneously.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You see! Playing as badly as you could you
haven&#39;t lost the hand,&quot; said Agonde. &quot;They needed
all their cards to win what they did.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">They were all absorbed in the game&mdash;whose interest
was now at its height&mdash;with the exception of
Segundo, who had abandoned himself to one of those
idle reveries in which the activity of the imagination
is stimulated by bodily ease. The voices of the
players reached his ears like a distant murmur; he
was a hundred leagues away; he was thinking of the
article he had just been reading, of which certain
expressions particularly encomiastic&mdash;mellifluous
phrases in which the critic artfully glossed over the
faults of the poet&mdash;had remained stamped on his
memory. When would his turn come to be judged
by the Madrid press? God alone knew. He lent
his attention once more to the conversation.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We must at least give him a serenade,&quot; declared
Genday.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;A serenade, indeed!&quot; responded Agonde. &quot;A
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page038" id="page038"></a>[pg&nbsp;038]</span>
great thing that! Something more than a serenade&mdash;we
must have some sort of a procession&mdash;a demonstration
which will show that the people here are
with him. We must appoint a committee to
receive him with rockets and bands of music. Let
those plotters at Do&ntilde;a Eufrasia&#39;s have something to
rage about.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The name of the other shop produced a storm of
exclamations, jests, and stamping of feet.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Have you heard the news?&quot; asked the waggish
Tropiezo. &quot;It seems that Nocedal has written a
very flattering letter to Do&ntilde;a Eufrasia, saying that as
he represents Don Carlos in Madrid so she, by reason
of her merits, ought to represent him in Vilamorta.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Homeric bursts of laughter and a general huzza
greeted this remark.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, that may be an invention; but it is true,
true as gospel, that Do&ntilde;a Eufrasia sent Don Carlos
her likeness with a complimentary inscription.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And the regiment? Have they fixed on the day
on which it is to take the field?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Of course. They say that the Abbot of Lubrego
is to command it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The hilarity of the assembly was redoubled, for
the Abbot of Lubrego was nearing his seventieth
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page039" id="page039"></a>[pg&nbsp;039]</span>
year, and was so feeble that he could scarcely hold
himself on his mule. A boy at this moment entered
the shop, swinging in his hand a glass bottle.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Don Saturnino!&quot; he cried, in a shrill voice.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What is it you want?&quot; answered the druggist,
mimicking his tones.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Give me some of what this smells like.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;All right,&quot; said Agonde, putting the bottle to
his nose. &quot;What does this smell like, Don Fermin?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Let me see&mdash;it smells something like&mdash;laudanum,
eh?&mdash;or arnica?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Arnica let it be, it is less dangerous. I hope it
will have a good effect.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is time to retire, gentlemen,&quot; said the Lawyer
Garc&iacute;a, consulting his silver timepiece.</p>

<p class="indent">Genday stood up and Segundo followed his example.</p>

<p class="indent">The tresillo party proceeded to settle accounts; calculating
winnings and losses, centavo by centavo, by
means of white counters and yellow counters. After
the close atmosphere of the shop the cool air of the
street was grateful; the night was mild and clear;
the stars shone with a friendly light and Segundo,
who was quick to perceive the poetic aspect of
things, felt tempted to leave his father and his uncle
without ceremony and walk along the road, alone,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page040" id="page040"></a>[pg&nbsp;040]</span>
according to his custom, to enjoy the beauty of the
night. But his Uncle Genday linked his arm
through his, saying:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You are to be congratulated, my boy.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Congratulated, uncle?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Weren&#39;t you crazy to get away from here?
Didn&#39;t you want to take your flight to some other
place? Haven&#39;t you a hatred for office work?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Good man,&quot; interposed the lawyer; &quot;he is crazy
enough as it is, and you want to unsettle his mind
still more&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hold your tongue, you fool! Don Victoriano is
coming here, we will present the boy to him and ask
him to give him a place. And he will give him one,
and a good one too; for whether he thinks so or not,
if he does not do what we ask him, the pancake will
cost him a loaf. The district is not what he imagines
it to be, and if his adherents do not keep their
eyes open the clergy will play a trick upon them.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And Primo? And Mendez de las Vides?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;They are no match for the priest. The day
least expected they will be made a show of; they
will hang their heads for shame. But you, my boy&mdash;think
well about it. You are not in love with the
law?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Segundo shrugged his shoulders with a smile.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page041" id="page041"></a>[pg&nbsp;041]</span>
&quot;Well, turn the matter over in your mind; think
what would suit you best. For you must be something;
you must stick your head in somewhere.
Would you like a justiceship? a place in the post-office?
in one of the departments?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">They had turned the corner of the Plaza on their
way to Garc&iacute;a&#39;s house and were passing under Leocadia&#39;s
window when the fragrance of the carnations
penetrated to Segundo&#39;s brain. He felt a poetic
revulsion of feeling and, dilating his nostrils to inhale
the perfume, he exclaimed:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Neither justice nor post-office employee. Say
no more on that point, uncle.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Don&#39;t insist, Clodio,&quot; said the lawyer bitterly.
&quot;He wants to be nothing, nothing but a downright
idler, to spend his life scribbling rhymes. Neither
more nor less. The money must be handed out for
the Institute, the University, the shirt-front, the
frock coat, the polished boots, and then, when one
thinks they are ready to do for themselves, back
they come, to be a burden to one, to smoke and to
eat at one&#39;s expense. I have three sons to spend my
money, to squeeze me dry, and not one to give me
any help. That is all these young gentlemen are
good for.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Segundo stopped, twisting the end of his mustache,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page042" id="page042"></a>[pg&nbsp;042]</span>
with a frown on his face. They all stood still
at the corner of the little plaza, as people are wont
to do when a conversation changes to a dispute.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don&#39;t know what puts that into your head,
father,&quot; declared the poet. &quot;Do you suppose that I
propose to myself never to be anything more than
Segundo Garc&iacute;a, the lawyer&#39;s son? If you do, you
are greatly mistaken. You may be very anxious to
be rid of the burden of supporting me, but you are
not half as anxious as I am to relieve you of it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, then, what are you waiting for? Your
uncle is proposing a variety of things to you and
none of them suits you. Do you want to begin by
being Minister?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The poet began to twist his mustache anew.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There is no use in being impatient, father. I
would make a very bad post-office clerk and a still
worse justice. I don&#39;t want to tie myself down to
any fixed career, in which everything is arranged
beforehand and moves by routine. In that case I
should be a lawyer like you or a notary like Uncle
Genday. If we really find Don Victoriano disposed
to do anything for me, ask some position&mdash;no matter
what&mdash;without fixed duties, that will enable me
to reside in Madrid. I will take care of the rest.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You will take care of the rest. Yes, yes, you say
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page043" id="page043"></a>[pg&nbsp;043]</span>
well. You will draw upon me for little sums, eh?
like your brother in the Philippine Islands. Let
me tell you for your guidance, then, that you needn&#39;t
do so. I didn&#39;t steal what I have, and I don&#39;t coin
money.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am not asking anything from you!&quot; cried
Segundo, in a burst of savage anger. &quot;Am I in
your way? I will get out of it, then; I will go to
America. That ends it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No,&quot; said the lawyer, calming down. &quot;Provided
you exact no more sacrifices from me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Not one! not if I were starving!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The lawyer&#39;s door opened; old Aunt G&aacute;spara in
her petticoat, looking like a fright, had come to let
them in. Tied around her head was a cotton handkerchief
which came so far over her face as almost to
conceal her sour features. Segundo drew back at
this picture of domestic life.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Aren&#39;t you coming in?&quot; asked his father.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am going with Uncle Genday.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Are you coming back soon?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Directly.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Walking down the square he communicated his
plans to Genday. The latter, a short man, with a
fiery temper, signified his approbation by movements
quick and restless as those of a lizard. His nephew&#39;s
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page044" id="page044"></a>[pg&nbsp;044]</span>
ideas were not displeasing to him. His active,
scheming mind, the mind of an electoral agent and a
clever notary, accepted vast projects more readily
than the methodical mind of the lawyer Garc&iacute;a.
Uncle and nephew were much of the same way of
thinking as to the best manner of profiting by Don
Victoriano&#39;s influence; conversing in this way they
reached Genday&#39;s house, and the servant of the latter&mdash;a
fresh-looking girl&mdash;opened the door for her
master with all the flattering obsequiousness of a
confirmed old bachelor&#39;s maid-servant. Instead of
returning home Segundo, preoccupied and excited,
walked down the plaza to the highroad, stopped at
the first clump of chestnut trees he came to, and seating
himself on the step of a wooden cross which the
Jesuits had erected there during the last mission,
gave himself up to the harmless diversion of contemplating
the evening star, the constellations, and all
the splendors of the heavenly bodies.</p>

<h2>IV.</h2>

<p class="indent">During the tiresome <i>siestas</i> of Vilamorta, while
the visitors to the springs digested their glasses of
mineral water and compensated themselves for the
loss of their morning sleep by a restorative nap, the
amateur musicians of the popular band practiced
by themselves the pieces they were shortly to execute
together. From the shoemaker&#39;s shop came
the melancholy notes of a flute; in the baker&#39;s resounded
the lively and martial strains of the horn;
in the tobacconist&#39;s moaned a clarionet; in the cloth-shop,
the suppressed sighs of an ophicleide filled the
air. Those who thus devoted themselves to the
worship of Euterpe were clerks in shops, younger
sons, the youthful element of Vilamorta. These
snatches of melody rose with piercing sonorousness
on the drowsy warm atmosphere. When the news
spread that Don Victoriano Andres de la Comba and
his family were expected to arrive within twenty-four
hours in the town, to leave it again immediately
for Las Vides, the brass band was tuned to the
highest pitch and ready to deafen, with any number
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page046" id="page046"></a>[pg&nbsp;046]</span>
of waltzes, dances, and quicksteps, the ears of the
illustrious statesman.</p>

<p class="indent">In the town an unusual animation was noticeable.
Agonde&#39;s house was opened, ventilated, and swept,
clouds of dust issuing through the windows, at one
of which, later on, appeared Agonde&#39;s sister, with a
fringe of hair over her forehead and wearing a pearl-shell
necklace. The housekeeper of the parish priest
of Cebre, a famous cook, went busily about the
kitchen, and the pounding of the mortar and the
sizzling of oil could be heard. Two hours before
the time of the arrival of the stage-coach from
Orense, that is to say at three o&#39;clock in the afternoon,
the committee of the notabilities of the Combista-radical
party were already crossing the plaza,
and Agonde stood waiting on the threshold of his
shop, having sacrificed to the solemnity of the occasion
his classic cap and velvet slippers, and wearing
patent-leather boots and a frock coat which made
him look more bull-necked and pot-bellied than ever.
The coach from Orense was entering the town from
the side next the wood, and, at the tinkling of the
bells, the clatter of the hoofs of its eight mules and
ponies, the creaking of its unwieldy bulk, the inhabitants
of Vilamorta looked out of their windows and
came to their doors; the reactionary shop only remained
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page047" id="page047"></a>[pg&nbsp;047]</span>
closed and hostile. When the cumbrous
vehicle turned into the square the excitement increased;
barefooted children climbed on the coach
steps, begging an <i>ochavo</i> in whining accents; the
fruit-women sitting in the arches straightened themselves
up to obtain a better view, and only Cansin,
the clothier, his hands in his trousers&#39; pockets, his
feet thrust into slippers, continued walking up and
down his shop with an Olympic air of indifference.
The overseer reined in the team, saying in soothing
accents to a rebellious mule:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;E-e-e-e-e-e-h! There, there, Can&oacute;niga.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The brass band, drawn up before the town-hall,
burst into a deafening prelude, and the first rocket
whizzed into the air sending forth a shower of sparks.
The crowd rushed <i>en masse</i> toward the door of the
coach, to offer their hands, their arms, anything, and
a stout lady and a priest, with a cotton checked
handkerchief tied around his temples, alighted from
it. Agonde, more amused than angry, made signs
to the musicians and the rocket-throwers to desist
from their task.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He is not coming yet! he is not coming yet!&quot; he
shouted. In effect, there were no other passengers
in the omnibus. The overseer hastened to
explain:</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page048" id="page048"></a>[pg&nbsp;048]</span>
&quot;They are just behind, not two steps off, as one
might say. In Count de Vilar&#39;s carriage, in the
barouche. On the Se&ntilde;ora&#39;s account. The luggage
is here. And they paid for the seats as if they had
occupied them.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">It was not long before the measured trot of Count
de Vilar&#39;s pair of horses was heard and the open
carriage, of an old-fashioned style, rolled majestically
into the plaza. Reclining on the back seat was a
man enveloped, notwithstanding the heat, in a cloth
cloak; at his side sat a lady in a gray linen duster,
the fanciful brim of her traveling-hat standing out
sharply against the pure blue of the sky. In the
front seat sat a little girl of some ten years and a
<i>mademoiselle</i>, a sort of transpyrenean nursery governess.
Segundo, who had kept in the background at
the arrival of the diligence, this time was less stubborn
and the hand which, covered with a long Su&egrave;de
glove, was stretched out in quest of a support, met
with the energetic and nervous pressure of another
hand. The Minister&#39;s lady looked with surprise at
the gallant, gave him a reserved salutation and, taking
the arm Agonde offered her, walked quickly into
the apothecary&#39;s.</p>

<p class="indent">The statesman was slower in alighting. His adherents
looked at him with surprise. He had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page049" id="page049"></a>[pg&nbsp;049]</span>
changed greatly since his last visit to Vilamorta&mdash;then
in the midst of the revolution&mdash;some eight or
ten years before. His iron-gray hair, whiter on the
temples, heightened the yellow hue of his complexion;
the whites of his eyes, too, were yellow and
streaked with little red veins; and his furrowed and
withered countenance bore unmistakable traces of
the anxieties of the struggle for social position, the
vicissitudes of the political bench, and the sedentary
labors of the forum. His frame hung loosely together,
being wanting in the erectness which is the
sign of physical vigor. When the handshakings
began, however, and the &quot;Delighted to see you&mdash;&mdash;&quot; &quot;At
last&mdash;&mdash;&quot; &quot;After an age&mdash;&mdash;&quot; resounded around
him, the dying gladiator revived, straightened himself
up, and an amiable smile parted his thin lips, lending
a pleasing expression to the now stern mouth. He
even opened his arms to Genday, who squirmed in
them like an eel, and he clapped the Alcalde on the
back. Garc&iacute;a, the lawyer, tried to attract attention
to himself, to distinguish himself among the others,
saying in the serious tone of one who expresses an
opinion in a very delicate matter:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There, upstairs, upstairs now, to rest and to take
some refreshment.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">At last the commotion calmed down, the great
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page050" id="page050"></a>[pg&nbsp;050]</span>
man entering the apothecary&#39;s, followed by Garc&iacute;a,
Genday, the Alcalde, and Segundo.</p>

<p class="indent">They seated themselves in Agonde&#39;s little parlor,
respectfully leaving to Don Victoriano the red rep
sofa, around which they drew their chairs in a semi-circle.
Shortly afterward the ladies made their appearance,
and, now without her hat, it could be seen
that Se&ntilde;ora de Comba was young and beautiful,
seeming rather the elder sister than the mother of the
little girl. The latter, with her luxuriant hair falling
down her back and her precocious womanly seriousness,
had the aspect of a sickly plant, while her
mother, a smiling blonde, seemed overflowing with
health. They spoke of the journey, of the fertile
borders of the Avieiro, of the weather, of the road;
the conversation was beginning to languish, when
Agonde&#39;s sister entered opportunely, preceded by
the housekeeper of the priest, carrying two enormous
trays filled with smoking cups of chocolate, for supper
was a meal unknown to the hosts. When the
trays were set on the table and the chocolate handed
around, the company grew more animated. The
Vilamortans, finding a congenial subject on which to
exercise their oratorical powers, began to press the
strangers, to eulogize the excellence of the viands,
and calling Se&ntilde;ora de la Comba by her baptismal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page051" id="page051"></a>[pg&nbsp;051]</span>
name, and adding an affectionate diminutive to that
of the little girl, they launched forth into exclamations
and questions.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Is the chocolate to your taste, Nieves?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do you like it thin or thick?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Nieves, take that morsel of cake for my sake; you
will find it excellent; only we have the secret of
making it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Come, Victorini&ntilde;a, don&#39;t be bashful; that fresh
butter goes very well with the hot bread.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;A morsel of toasted sponge-cake. Ah-ha! You
don&#39;t have cake like that in Madrid, eh?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No,&quot; answered the girl, in a clear and affected
voice. &quot;In Madrid we eat crullers and doughnuts
with our chocolate.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is the fashion here to take sponge-cake with it,
not crullers. Take that one on the top, that brown
one. That&#39;s nothing, a bird could eat it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Don Victoriano joined in the conversation, praising
the bread, saying he could not eat it, as it had
been absolutely prohibited to him, for his malady
required that he should abstain from starch and
gluten in every form&mdash;indeed, he had bread sent
him from France, bread prepared <i>ad hoc</i> without
those elements&mdash;and as he spoke, he turned toward
Agonde, who nodded with an air of intelligence,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page052" id="page052"></a>[pg&nbsp;052]</span>
showing that he understood the Latin phrase. And
Don Victoriano regretted doubly the prohibition
now, for there was no bread to be compared to the
Vilamorta bread&mdash;which was better of its kind than
cake, yes indeed. The Vilamortans smiled, highly
flattered, but Garc&iacute;a, with an eloquent shake of the
head, said that the bread was deteriorating, that it
was not now what it had formerly been, and that
only Pellejo, the baker of the plaza, made it conscientiously,
having the patience to select the wheat,
grain by grain, not letting a single wormeaten one
pass. It was for this reason that his loaves turned
out so sweet and substantial. Then a discussion
arose as to whether bread should be porous or the
contrary, and as to whether hot bread was wholesome.</p>

<p class="indent">Don Victoriano, reanimated by these homely details,
talked of his childhood, of the slices of bread
spread with butter or molasses which he used to
eat between meals, and when he added that his
uncle, the priest, occasionally administered a sound
drubbing to him, a smile once more softened the
deep lines of his face. This expansion of feeling
gave a sweeter expression to his countenance, effacing
from it the traces left by years of strife, the scars
of the wounds received in the battle of life, illuminating
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page053" id="page053"></a>[pg&nbsp;053]</span>
it with a reflection from his vanished youth.
How he longed to see again a grapevine in Las
Vides from which he had robbed grapes a hundred
times when he was a child.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And you will rob them again now,&quot; exclaimed
Clodio Genday gayly. &quot;We must tell the master of
Las Vides to put a guard over the vine of Jaen.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The jest was received with demonstrations of
hilarity, and the girl laughed with her shrill laugh at
the idea of her papa robbing a grapevine. Segundo
only smiled. His eyes were fixed on Don Victoriano,
and he was thinking of what his life had been. He
went over in his mind the history of the great man:
At Segundo&#39;s age Don Victoriano, too, was an
obscure lawyer, buried in Vilamorta, eager to break
from the shell. He had gone to Madrid, where a
celebrated jurisconsult had taken him as his assistant.
The jurisconsult was a politician, and Victoriano followed
in his footsteps. How did he begin to prosper?
This period was shrouded in obscurity. Some
said one thing, some another. Vilamorta found him,
when it least expected, its candidate and representative.
Once in Congress Don Victoriano&#39;s importance
grew steadily, and when the Revolution of September
came it found him in a sufficiently exalted
position to be improvised a minister. The brief ministry
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page054" id="page054"></a>[pg&nbsp;054]</span>
gave him neither time to wear out his popularity
nor to give proof of special gifts, and, with his
prestige almost intact, the Restoration admitted him
as a member of a fusionist cabinet. He had just
laid down the portfolio and come to re-establish his
shattered health in his native place, where his influence
was strong and incontestible, thanks to his alliance
with the illustrious house of Mendez de las
Vides. Segundo asked himself if a lot like Don Victoriano&#39;s
would satisfy his aspirations. Don Victoriano
had wealth&mdash;stocks in banks and shares in
railways among whose directors the name of the able
jurisconsult figured. Our versifier raised his eyebrows
disdainfully and glanced at the Minister&#39;s
wife; that graceful beauty certainly did not love her
lord. She was the daughter of a younger son of the
house of Las Vides&mdash;a magistrate; she had probably
married her husband, allured by his position. No;
most assuredly the poet did not envy the politician.
Why had this man risen to the eminent position he
occupied? What extraordinary gifts did he possess?
A diffuse parliamentary orator, a passive minister,
with some forensic ability&mdash;sum total, a mediocrity.</p>

<p class="indent">While these reflections were passing through
Segundo&#39;s mind, Se&ntilde;ora de Comba amused herself
by examining minutely the dress and the appearance
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page055" id="page055"></a>[pg&nbsp;055]</span>
of everyone present. She took in every detail,
under her half-closed lids, of the toilet of Carmen
Agonde, who was arrayed in a tight-fitting deep blue
bodice that sent the blood to her plethoric cheeks.
She next lowered her mocking glance to the patent-leather
boots of the pharmacist, and then raised them
again to Clodio Genday&#39;s fingers, stained by the
cigar, and the purple and white checked velvet waistcoat
of the lawyer García. Finally, her glance fell
on Segundo, in critical examination of his attire.
But another glance, steady and ardent, cast it back
like a shield.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page056" id="page056"></a>[pg&nbsp;056]</span></p>

<h2>V.</h2>

<p class="indent">Agonde rose early on the following morning, and
descended shortly afterward to his shop, leaving his
guests wrapped in their slumbers, and Carmen
charged, the moment they should stir, to pour the
chocolate into their mouths. The apothecary desired
to enjoy the effect produced in the town by
Don Victoriano&#39;s sojourn in his house. He was
reclining in his leather-covered easy-chair when he
saw Tropiezo riding past on his gray mule, and
called out to him:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hello! Hello! Where are you bound for so
early?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;For Doas, man. I have not a minute to spare.&quot;
And saying this the doctor alighted from his mule,
which he tied to an iron ring fastened in the wall.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Is the case so urgent?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Urgent? That it is. The old woman, the grandmother
of Ramon, the confectioner. It appears she
has already received the last sacrament.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And it is only now they have sent for you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No; I went to see her yesterday, and I applied
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page057" id="page057"></a>[pg&nbsp;057]</span>
two dozen leeches, that drew their fill of blood from
her. She looked like a dying kid; she was very
weak, and as thin as a wafer. Perhaps if I had given
her something that I thought of, instead of applying
leeches&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ah! a trip,&quot; interrupted Agonde maliciously.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Life is a series of trips,&quot; responded the doctor,
shrugging his shoulders. &quot;And upstairs?&quot; he added,
raising his eyes interrogatively to the ceiling.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Snoring like princes.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And he&mdash;how does he look?&quot; asked Don Fermin,
lowering his voice and dwelling on every word.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He?&quot; repeated Agonde, following his example.
&quot;So-so. Oldish. And very gray.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But what is the matter with him? Let us hear.
For as to being sick, he is that.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He has&mdash;a new disease&mdash;a very strange one, one
of the latest fashion.&quot; And Agonde smiled maliciously.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;New?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Agonde half-closed his eyes, bent toward Tropiezo,
and whispered something in his ear.</p>

<p class="indent">Tropiezo burst into a laugh; suddenly he looked
very serious, and tapping his nose repeatedly with
his forefinger:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I know, I know,&quot; he said emphatically. &quot;And the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page058" id="page058"></a>[pg&nbsp;058]</span>
waters here, and some others in France, are the only
cure for that disease. If he drinks a few glasses
from the spring, he will be himself again.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Tropiezo emitted his dictamen leaning on the
counter, forgetful of the mule that was stamping impatiently
at the door.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And the Se&ntilde;ora&mdash;what does she say of her husband&#39;s
state of health?&quot; he suddenly asked, with a
wink.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What should she say of it, man? Probably she
does not know that it is serious.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">A look of derision lighted up the inexpressive
features of the physician; he glanced at Agonde and
smothering another burst of laughter, began:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The Se&ntilde;ora&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Chut!&quot; interrupted the apothecary furiously.
The whole Comba family were making an irruption
into the shop through the small door of the porch.
Mother and daughter formed a charming group,
both wearing wide-brimmed hats of coarse straw
adorned with enormous bows of flame-colored bunting.
Their &eacute;cru cotton gowns embroidered with red
braid completed the rustic character of their costumes,
reminding one of a bunch of poppies and
straw. The girl&#39;s luxuriant dark hair hung loose over
her shoulders, and the fair locks of the mother curled
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page059" id="page059"></a>[pg&nbsp;059]</span>
in a tangled mass under the shade of her broad-brimmed
hat. Nieves did not wear gloves nor was
there visible on her face a trace of powder, or of any
other of the cosmetics whose use is imputed unjustly
by the women of the provinces to the Madridlenians;
on the contrary, her rosy ears and neck showed
signs of energetic friction with the towel and cold
water. As for Don Victoriano, the ravages made in
his countenance by care and sickness were still more
apparent in the morning light; it was not, as
Agonde had said, age that was visible there; it was
virility, but tortured, exhausted, wounded to death.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why! Have you had chocolate already?&quot; asked
Agonde, in confusion.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, friend Saturnino, nor shall we take it, with
your permission, until we return. Don&#39;t trouble
yourself on our account. Victorini&ntilde;a has ransacked
your pantry&mdash;your closets&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The child half opened a handkerchief which she
held by the four corners, disclosing a provision of
bread, cake, and the cheese of the country.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;At least let me bring you a whole cheese. I will
go see if there is not some fresh bread, just out of
the oven&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Don Victoriano objected&mdash;let him not be deprived
of the pleasure of going to breakfast in the poplar-grove
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page060" id="page060"></a>[pg&nbsp;060]</span>
near the spring, just as he had done when a
boy. Agonde remarked that those articles of food
were not wholesome for him, to which Tropiezo,
scratching the tip of his ear, responded sceptically:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Bah! bah! bah! Those are new-fangled notions.
What is wholesome for the body&mdash;can&#39;t they understand
that&mdash;is what the body craves. If the
gentleman likes bread&mdash;and for your malady, Se&ntilde;or
Don Victoriano, there is nothing like the waters
here. I don&#39;t know why people go to give their
money to those French when we have better things
at home than any they can give us.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The Minister looked at Tropiezo with keen interest
depicted on his countenance. He called to mind
his last visit to Sanchez del Abrojo and the contraction
of the lips with which the learned practitioner
had said to him:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I would send you to Carlsbad or to Vichy, but
those waters are not always beneficial. At times
they hasten the natural course of a disease. Rest
for a time, and diet yourself&mdash;we will see how you
are when you return in the autumn.&quot; And what a
look Sanchez del Abrojo put on when he said this!
An impenetrable, sphinx-like expression. The positive
assertion of Tropiezo awoke tumultuous hopes
in Don Victoriano&#39;s breast. This village practitioner
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page061" id="page061"></a>[pg&nbsp;061]</span>
must know a great deal from experience, more perhaps
than the pompous doctors of the capital.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Come, papa,&quot; said the child impatiently, pulling
him by the sleeve.</p>

<p class="indent">They took the path toward the grove. Vilamorta,
naturally given to early rising, was more full of
activity at this hour than in the afternoon. The
shops were open, the baskets of the fruit-venders
were already filled with fruit. Cansin walked up
and down his establishment with his hands in his
pockets, affecting to have noticed nothing, so as not
to be obliged to bid good-morning to Agonde and
acknowledge his triumph. Pellejo, covered with
flour, was haggling with three shopkeepers from
Cebre, who wanted to buy some of his best wheat.
Ramon, the confectioner, was dividing chocolate into
squares on a large board placed on the counter and
rapidly stamping them with a hot iron before they
should have time to cool.</p>

<p class="indent">The morning was cloudless and the sun was
already unusually hot. The party, augmented by
Garc&iacute;a and Genday, walked through orchards and
cornfields until they reached the entrance to the
walk. Don Victoriano uttered an exclamation of
joy. It was the same double row of elms bordering
the river, the foaming and joyous Avieiro, that ran
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page062" id="page062"></a>[pg&nbsp;062]</span>
on sparkling in gentle cascades, washing with a pleasant
murmur the rocks, worn smooth by the action
of the current. He recognized the thick osier plantations;
he remembered all his longings of the day
before and leaned, full of emotion, on the parapet of
the walk. The scene was almost deserted; half a
dozen melancholy and bilious-looking individuals,
visitors to the springs, were walking slowly up and
down, discussing their ailments in low tones, and
eructating the bicarbonate of the waters. Nieves,
leaning back on a stone bench, gazed at the river.
The child touched her on the shoulder, saying:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Mamma, the young man we saw yesterday.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">On the opposite bank Segundo Garc&iacute;a was standing
on a rock, absorbed in meditation, his straw hat
pushed far back on his head, his hand resting on his
hip, doubtless with the purpose of preserving his
equilibrium in so dangerous a position. Nieves reproved
the little girl, saying:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Don&#39;t be silly, child. You startled me. Salute
the gentleman.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He is not looking this way. Ah! now he is looking.
Salute him, you, mamma. He is taking off
his hat, he is going to fall! There! now he is safe.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Don Victoriano descended the stone steps leading
to the spring. The abode of the naiad was a humble
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page063" id="page063"></a>[pg&nbsp;063]</span>
grotto&mdash;a shed supported on rough posts, a small
basin overflowing with the water from the spring,
some wretched hovels for the bathers, and a strong
and sickening odor of rotten eggs, caused by the
stagnation of the sulphur water, were all that the
fastidious tourist found there. Notwithstanding
this, Don Victoriano&#39;s soul was filled with the purest
joy. In this naiad he beheld his youth, his lost
youth&mdash;the age of illusions, of hopes blooming as the
banks of the Avieiro. How many mornings had he
come to drink from the fountain, for a jest, to wash
his face with the water, which enjoyed throughout
the country the reputation of possessing extraordinary
curative virtue for the eyes. Don Victoriano
stretched out his hands, plunged them into the
warm current, feeling it slip through his fingers with
delight, and playing with it and caressing it as one
caresses a loved being. But the undulating form of
the naiad escaped from him as youth escapes from
us&mdash;without the possibility of detaining it. Then
the ex-Minister felt a thirst awaken in him to drink
the waters. Beside him on the edge of the basin
was a glass; and the keeper, a poor old man in his
dotage, presented it to him with an idiotic smile.
Don Victoriano drank, closing his eyes, with indescribable
pleasure, enjoying the mysterious water,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page064" id="page064"></a>[pg&nbsp;064]</span>
charmed by the magic arts of memory. When he
had drained the glass he drew himself up and
ascended the stairs with a firm and elastic step.
Victorini&ntilde;a, who was breakfasting on bread and
cheese in the avenue, was astonished when her father
took a piece of bread from her lap, saying gayly:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We are all God&#39;s creatures.&quot;</p>


<hr class="hr2" />

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page065" id="page065"></a>[pg&nbsp;065]</span></p>

<h2>VI.</h2>

<p class="indent">Almost as much as by Don Victoriano&#39;s arrival
was Vilamorta excited by the arrival of Se&ntilde;or de las
Vides, accompanied by his steward, Primo Genday.
This event happened on the afternoon of the memorable
day on which Don Victoriano had infringed
the commands of science by eating half a pound of
fresh bread. At three o&#39;clock, under a blazing sun,
Genday the elder and Mendez entered the plaza,
the latter mounted on a powerful mule, the former
on an ordinary nag.</p>

<p class="indent">Se&ntilde;or de las Vides was a little old man as dry as
a vine branch. His carefully shaven cheeks, his thin
lips and aristocratically pointed nose and chin, his
shrewd, kind eyes, surrounded by innumerable crows&#39;
feet, his intellectual profile, his beardless face, called
loudly for the curled wig, the embroidered coat and
the gold snuff-box of the Campomanes and Arandas.
With his delicate and expressive countenance the
countenance of Primo Genday contrasted strongly.
The steward&#39;s complexion was white and red, he had
the fine and transparent skin, showing the full veins
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page066" id="page066"></a>[pg&nbsp;066]</span>
underneath, of those who are predisposed to hemiplegy.
His eyes were of a greenish color, one of
them being attached, as it were, to the lax and
drooping lid, while the other rolled around with mischievous
vivacity. His silvery curls gave him a distant
resemblance to Louis Philippe, as he is represented
on the coins which bear his effigy.</p>

<p class="indent">By a combination not unusual in small towns
Primo Genday and his brother Clodio served under
opposite political banners, both being in reality of
one mind and both pursuing the same end; Clodio
ranged himself on the side of the radicals, Primo was
the support of the Carlist party, and in cases of
emergency, in the electoral contests, they clasped
hands over the fence. When the hoofs of Primo
Genday&#39;s nag resounded on the paving-stones, the
windows of the reactionary shop were opened and
two or three hands were waved in friendly welcome.
Primo paused, and Mendez continued on his way to
Agonde&#39;s door, where he dismounted.</p>

<p class="indent">He was received in Don Victoriano&#39;s arms, and
then disappeared among the shadows of the staircase.
The mule remained fastened to the ring,
stamping impatiently, while the onlookers on the
plaza contemplated with respect the nobleman&#39;s old-fashioned
harness of embossed leather, ornamented
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page067" id="page067"></a>[pg&nbsp;067]</span>
with silver, bright with use. One after another
other mules and horses were brought to join the
first comer. And the crowd assigned them their
riders with considerable judgment. The chestnut
nag of the alguazil, a fine animal, with a saddle and
a silk headstall, was no doubt for the Minister. The
black donkey with the side-saddle&mdash;who could doubt
that it was for the Se&ntilde;ora? The other gentle white
donkey they would give to the little girl. The
Alcalde&#39;s ass was for the maid. Agonde would ride
the mare he always rode, the Morena, that had
more malanders on her head than hairs in her tail.
During this time the radicals, Garc&iacute;a, Clodio, Genday,
and Ramon, were discussing the respective
merits of the animals and the condition of their trappings
and calculating the probabilities of their being
able to reach Las Vides before nightfall. The lawyer
shook his head, saying emphatically and sententiously:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;They are taking their time about it if they expect
to do that.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And they are bringing the alguazil&#39;s horse for
Don Victoriano!&quot; exclaimed the tobacconist.
&quot;Tricky as the very devil! There will be a scene.
When you rode him, Segundo, did he play you no
trick?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page068" id="page068"></a>[pg&nbsp;068]</span>
&quot;Me, no. But he is lively.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You shall see, you shall see.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The travelers were now coming out of the house,
and the cavalcade began to form. The ladies seated
themselves in their side-saddles and the men settled
their feet in their stirrups. Then the scene predicted
by the tobacconist took place, to the great scandal
and the further delay of the party. As soon as the
alguazil&#39;s nag became aware of the presence of a
female of his race he began to snuff the air excitedly,
neighing fiercely. Don Victoriano gathered up the
reins, but, before the animal had felt the iron in his
mouth, he became so unmanageable, first rearing,
then kicking violently, and finally turning his
head around to try to bite his rider&#39;s legs,
that Don Victoriano, somewhat pale, thought
it prudent to dismount. Agonde, furious, dismounted
also.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What an infernal animal!&quot; he cried. &quot;Here,
brutes&mdash;who told you to bring the alguazil&#39;s horse?
One would suppose you didn&#39;t know it was a wild
beast. You&mdash;Alcalde, or you, Garc&iacute;a&mdash;quick, go for
Requinto&#39;s mule; it is only two steps from here.
Se&ntilde;or Don Victoriano, take my mule. And that
tiger, to the stable with him!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No,&quot; interrupted Segundo, &quot;I will ride him as he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page069" id="page069"></a>[pg&nbsp;069]</span>
is already saddled. I will go with you as far as the
cross.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">And Segundo, providing himself with a strong
switch, caught the nag by the mane and at a bound
was in the saddle. Instead of leaning his weight on
the stirrup he pressed the animal&#39;s sides between his
legs, raining a shower of blows at the same time on
his head. The animal, which was already beginning
to curvet and prance again, gave a snort of pain,
and now, quivering and subdued, obeyed his rider&#39;s
touch. The cavalcade put itself in motion as soon
as Requinto&#39;s mule was brought, after handshakings,
waving of hats, and even a timid <i>viva</i>, from what
quarter no one knew. The cort&eacute;ge proceeded along
the highway, the mare and the mules heading the
procession, the donkeys following behind, and at
their side the nag, kept in order by dint of switching.
The sun was sinking in the west, turning the
dust of the road into gold; the chestnut trees cast
lengthened shadows on the ground, and from the
osier-brake came a pleasant breeze laden with moisture
from the river.</p>

<p class="indent">Segundo rode along in silence; Victorini&ntilde;a, delighted
to be riding on a donkey, smiled, making
fruitless efforts to hide with her frock her sharp
knee-bones, which the shape of the saddle compelled
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page070" id="page070"></a>[pg&nbsp;070]</span>
her to raise and uncover. Nieves, leaning back in
her saddle, opened her rose-lined &eacute;cru lace parasol,
and, as they started, drew from her bosom a diminutive
watch, which she consulted for the hour. A few
moments of embarrassed silence followed. At last
Segundo felt that it was necessary to say something:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How are you doing, Victorini&ntilde;a?&quot; he said to the
child. &quot;Are you comfortable?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, quite comfortable.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I warrant you would rather ride on my horse.
If you are not afraid I will take you before
me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The girl, whose embarrassment had now reached
its height, lowered her eyes without answering; her
mother, smiling graciously, however, now joined in
the conversation.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And tell me, Garc&iacute;a, why don&#39;t you address the
child as <i>thou</i>? You treat her with so much ceremony!
You will make her fancy she is a young
lady already.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I should not dare to do so without her permission.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Come, Victorini&ntilde;a, tell this gentleman he has
your permission.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The child took refuge in that invincible muteness
of growing girls whom an exquisite and precocious
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page071" id="page071"></a>[pg&nbsp;071]</span>
sensibility renders painfully shy. A smile parted
her lips, and at the same time her eyes filled with
tears. Mademoiselle said something gently to her
in French; meanwhile Nieves and Segundo, laughing
confidentially at the incident, found the way
smoothed for them to begin a conversation.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;When do you think we shall arrive at Las Vides?
Is it a pretty place? Shall we be comfortable there?
How will it agree with Victoriano? What sort of a
life shall we lead? Shall we have many visitors?
Is there a garden?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Las Vides is a beautiful place,&quot; said Segundo.
&quot;It has an air of antiquity&mdash;a lordly air, as it were.
I like the escutcheon, and a magnificent grapevine
that covers the courtyard, and the camellias and
lemon trees in the orchards, that look like good-sized
chestnut trees, and the view of the river, and,
above all, a pine grove that talks and even sings&mdash;don&#39;t
laugh&mdash;that sings; yes, Se&ntilde;ora, and better
than most professional singers. Don&#39;t you believe
it? Well, you shall see for yourself presently.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Nieves looked with lively curiosity at the young
man and then hastily turned her glance aside, remembering
the quick and nervous hand-pressure of
the day before, when she was alighting from the
carriage. For the second time in the space of a few
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page072" id="page072"></a>[pg&nbsp;072]</span>
hours this young man had surprised her. Nieves led
an extremely regular life in Madrid&mdash;the life of the
middle classes, in which all the incidents are commonplace.
She went to mass and shopped in the
morning; in the afternoon she went to the Retiro,
or made visits; in the evening she went to her parents&#39;
house or to the theater with her husband; on
rare occasions to some ball or banquet at the house
of the Duke of Puenteanchas, a client of Don Victoriano&#39;s.
When the latter received the portfolio it
made little change in Nieves&#39; way of life. She received
a few more salutations than before in the
Retiro; the clerks in the shops were more attentive
to her; the Duchess of Puenteanchas said some flattering
things to her, calling her &quot;pet,&quot; and here ended
for Nieves the pleasure of the ministry. The trip
to Vilamorta, the picturesque country of which she
had so often heard her father speak, was a novel
incident in her monotonous life. Segundo seemed
to her a curious detail of the journey. He looked
at her and spoke to her in so odd a way. Bah, fancies!
Between this young man and herself there was
nothing in common. A passing acquaintance, like so
many others to be met here at every step. So the
pines sang, did they? A misfortune for Gayarre!
And Nieves smiled graciously, dissembling her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page073" id="page073"></a>[pg&nbsp;073]</span>
strange thoughts and went on asking questions, to
which Segundo responded in expressive phrases.
Night was beginning to fall. Suddenly, the cavalcade,
leaving the highroad, turned into a path that
led among pine groves and woods. At a turn of the
path could be seen the picturesque dark stone cross,
whose steps invited to prayer or to sentimental reverie.
Agonde stopped here and took his leave of
the party, and Segundo followed his example.</p>

<p class="indent">As the tinkling of the donkeys&#39; bells grew fainter
in the distance Segundo felt an inexplicable sensation
of loneliness and abandonment steal over him,
as if he had just parted forever from persons who
were dear to him or who played an important part in
his life. &quot;A pretty fool I am!&quot; said the poet to himself.
&quot;What have I to do with these people or they
with me? Nieves has invited me to spend a few
days at Las Vides, <i>en famille</i>. When Nieves returns
to Madrid this winter she will speak of me as
&#39;That lawyer&#39;s son, that we met at Vilamorta.&#39;
Who am I? What position should I occupy in her
house? An altogether secondary one. That of a
boy who is treated with consideration because his
father disposes of votes.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">While Segundo was thus caviling, the apothecary
overtook him, and horse and mule pursued their way
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page074" id="page074"></a>[pg&nbsp;074]</span>
side by side. In the twilight the poet could distinguish
the placid smile of Agonde, his red cheeks,
looking redder in contrast to the lustrous black mustache,
his expression of sensual amiability and epicurean
beatitude. An enviable lot was the apothecary&#39;s.
This man was happy in his comfortable and
well-ordered shop, with his circle of friends, his cap
and his embroidered slippers, taking life as one takes
a glass of cordial, sipping it with enjoyment, in
peace and harmony, along with the other guests at
the banquet of life. Why should not Segundo be
satisfied with what satisfied Agonde perfectly?
Whence came this longing for something that was
not precisely money, nor pleasure, nor fame, nor
love&mdash;which partook of all these, which embraced
them all and which perhaps nothing would satisfy?</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Segundo.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Eh?&quot; he answered, turning his head toward
Agonde.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How silent you are, my boy! What do you
think of the Minister?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What would you have me think of him?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And the Se&ntilde;ora? Come, you have noticed
her, I warrant. She wears black silk stockings,
like the priests. When she was mounting the
donkey&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page075" id="page075"></a>[pg&nbsp;075]</span>
&quot;I am going to take a gallop as far as Vilamorta.
Do you care to join me, Saturnino?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Gallop with this mule? I should arrive there
with my stomach in my mouth. Gallop you, if you
have a fancy for doing so.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The nag galloped for half a league or so, urged by
his rider&#39;s whip. As they drew near the canebrake
by the river, Segundo slackened his horse&#39;s gallop to
a very slow walk. It was now almost dark and the
cool mists rose, moist and clinging, from the bosom
of the Avieiro. Segundo remembered that it was
two or three days since he had put his foot in Leocadia&#39;s
house. No doubt the schoolmistress was
now fretting herself to death, weeping and watching
for him. This thought brought sudden balm to
Segundo&#39;s wounded spirit. How tenderly Leocadia
loved him! With what joy did she welcome him!
How deeply his poetry, his words, moved her! And
he&mdash;why was it that he did not share her ardor?
Of this exclusive, this absolute, boundless love,
Segundo had never deigned to accept even the half;
and of all the tender terms of endearment invented
by the muse he chose for Leocadia the least poetical,
the least romantic; as we separate the gold and
silver in our purse from the baser coin, setting aside
for the beggar the meanest copper, so did Segundo
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page076" id="page076"></a>[pg&nbsp;076]</span>
dispense with niggard hand the treasures of his love.
A hundred times had it happened to him, in his
walks through the country, to fill his hat with violets,
with hyacinths and branches of blackberry blossoms,
only to throw them all into the river on reaching
the village, in order not to carry them to
Leocadia.</p>

<h2>VII.</h2>

<p class="indent">While she distributed their tasks among the
children, saying to one, &quot;Take care to make this
hem straight,&quot; to another, &quot;Make this seam even, the
stitch smaller,&quot; to a third, &quot;Use your handkerchief
instead of your dress,&quot; and to still another, &quot;Sit
still, child, don&#39;t move your feet,&quot; Leocadia cast a
glance from time to time toward the plaza in the
hope of seeing Segundo pass by. But no Segundo
was to be seen. The flies settled themselves to
sleep, buzzing, on the ceiling; the heat abated; the
afternoon came, and the children went away. Leocadia
felt a profound sadness take possession of her
and, without waiting to put the house in order, she
went to her room and threw herself on the bed.</p>

<p class="indent">The glass door was pushed gently open, and some
one entered softly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Mamma,&quot; said the intruder, in a low voice.</p>

<p class="indent">The schoolmistress did not answer.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Mamma, mamma,&quot; repeated the hunchback, in a
louder voice. &quot;Mamma!&quot; he shouted at last.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Is that you? What do you want?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page078" id="page078"></a>[pg&nbsp;078]</span>
&quot;Are you ill?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, child.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;As you went to bed&mdash;&mdash;&#39;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I have a slight headache. There, leave me in
peace.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Minguitos turned round and walked in silence
toward the door. As her eyes fell on the protuberance
of his back, a sharp pang pierced the heart of
the schoolmistress. How many tears that hump had
cost her in other days. She raised herself on her
elbow.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Minguitos!&quot; she called.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What is it, mamma?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Don&#39;t go away. How do you feel to-day?
Have you any pain?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I feel pretty well, mamma. Only my chest
hurts me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Let me see; come here.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Leocadia sat up in the bed and, taking the child&#39;s
head between her hands, looked at him with a
mother&#39;s hungry look. Minguitos&#39; face was long
and of a melancholy cast; the prominent lower jaw
was in keeping with the twisted and misshapen body
that reminded one of a building shaken out of shape
by an earthquake or a tree twisted by a hurricane.
Minguitos&#39; deformity was not congenital. He had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page079" id="page079"></a>[pg&nbsp;079]</span>
always been sickly, indeed, and it had always been
remarked that his head seemed too heavy for his
body, and that his legs seemed too frail to support
him. Leocadia recalled one by one the incidents of
his childhood. At five years old the boy had met
with an accident&mdash;a fall down the stairs; from that
day he lost all his liveliness; he walked little and
never ran. He contracted a habit of sitting Turkish
fashion, playing marbles for hours at a time. If he
rose his legs soon warned him to sit down again.
When he stood, his movements were vacillating and
awkward. When he was quiet he felt no pain, but
when he turned any part of his body, he experienced
slight pains in the spinal column. The trouble increased
with time; the boy complained of a feeling
as if an iron band were compressing his chest. Then
his mother, now thoroughly alarmed, consulted a
famous physician, the best in Orense. He prescribed
frictions with iodine, large doses of phosphates
of lime, and sea-bathing. Leocadia hastened
with the boy to a little sea-port. After taking two
or three baths, the trouble increased; he could not
bend his body; his spinal column was rigid and it
was only when he was in a horizontal position that
he felt any relief from his now severe pains. Sores
appeared on his skin, and one morning when Leocadia
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page080" id="page080"></a>[pg&nbsp;080]</span>
begged him with tears to straighten himself,
and tried to lift him up by the arms, he uttered a
horrible cry.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am broken in two, mamma&mdash;I am broken in
two,&quot; he repeated with anguish, while his mother,
with trembling fingers sought to find what had
caused his cry.</p>

<p class="indent">It was true! The backbone had bent outward,
forming an angle on a level with his shoulderblades,
the softened vertebr&aelig; had sunk and <i>cifosis</i>, the
hump, the indelible mark of irremediable calamity,
was to deform henceforth this child who was dearer
to her than her life. The schoolmistress had had a
moment of animal and sublime anguish, the anguish
of the wild beast that sees its young mutilated. She
had uttered shriek after shriek, cursing the doctor,
cursing herself, tearing her hair and digging her nails
into her flesh. Afterward tears had come and she
had showered kisses, delirious, but soothing and
sweet, on the boy, and her grief took a resigned
form. During nine years Leocadia had had no other
thought than to watch over her little cripple by night
and by day, sheltering him in her love, amusing with
ingenious inventions the idle hours of his sedentary
childhood. A thousand incidents of this time recurred
to Leocadia&#39;s memory. The boy suffered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page081" id="page081"></a>[pg&nbsp;081]</span>
from obstinate dyspn&oelig;a, due to the pressure of the
sunken vertebr&aelig; on the respiratory organs, and his
mother would get up in the middle of the night and
go in her bare feet to listen to his breathing and to
raise his pillows. As these recollections came to her
mind Leocadia felt her heart melt and something
stir within her like the remains of a great love, the
warm ashes of an immense fire, and she experienced
the unconscious reaction of maternity, the irresistible
impulse which makes a mother see in her grown-up
son only the infant she has nursed and protected, to
whom she would have given her blood, if it had been
necessary, instead of milk. And uttering a cry of
love, pressing her feverish lips passionately to the
pallid temples of the hunchback, she said, falling
back naturally into the caressing expressions of the
dialect:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;<i>Malpocadi&ntilde;o.</i> Who loves you? say, who loves
you dearly? Who?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You don&#39;t love me, mamma. You don&#39;t love
me,&quot; the boy returned, half-smiling, leaning his head
with delight on the bosom that had sheltered his sad
childhood. The mother, meantime, wildly kissed
his hair, his neck, his eyes&mdash;as if to make up for lost
time&mdash;lavishing upon him the honeyed words with
which infants are beguiled, words profaned in hours
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page082" id="page082"></a>[pg&nbsp;082]</span>
of passion, which overflowed in the pure channel of
maternal love.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My treasure&mdash;my king&mdash;my glory.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">At last the hunchback felt a tear fall on his cheek.
Delicious assuagement! At first, the tears were
large and round, scorching almost, but soon they
came in a gentle shower and then ceased altogether,
and there remained where they had fallen only a
grateful sense of coolness. Passionate phrases
rushed simultaneously from the lips of mother and
son.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do you love me dearly, dearly, dearly? As
much as your whole life?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;As much, my life, my treasure.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Will you always love me?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Always, always, my joy.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Will you do something to please me, mamma?
I want to ask you&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;A favor. Don&#39;t turn your face away!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The hunchback observed that his mother&#39;s form
suddenly grew stiff and rigid as a bar of iron. He
no longer felt the sweet warmth of her moist eyelids,
and the gentle contact of her wet lashes on his
cheek. In a voice that had a metallic sound Leocadia
asked her son:</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page083" id="page083"></a>[pg&nbsp;083]</span>
&quot;And what is the favor you want? Let me hear
it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Minguitos murmured without bitterness, with
resignation:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Nothing, mamma, nothing. I was only in
jest.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But what was the favor you were going to ask
me?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Nothing, nothing, indeed.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, you wanted to ask something,&quot; persisted the
schoolmistress, seizing the pretext to give vent to her
anger. &quot;Otherwise you are very deceitful and very
sly. You keep everything hidden in your breast.
Those are the lessons Flores teaches you; do you
think I don&#39;t notice it?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Saying this, she pushed the boy away from her,
and sprang from the bed. In the hall outside
almost at the same moment was heard a firm and
youthful step. Leocadia trembled, and turning to
Minguitos, stammered:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Go, go to Flores. Leave me alone. I do not feel
well, and you make me worse,&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Segundo&#39;s brow was clouded, and as soon as the
joy of seeing him had subsided Leocadia was seized
with the desire to restore him to good humor. She
waited patiently for a fitting opportunity, however,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page084" id="page084"></a>[pg&nbsp;084]</span>
and when this came, throwing her arms around his
neck, she began with the complaint: Where had he
kept himself? Why had he stayed away so long?
The poet unburdened himself of his grievances. It
was intolerable to follow in the train of a great man.
And allowing himself to be carried away by the
pleasure of speaking of what occupied his mind he
described Don Victoriano and the radicals, he satirized
Agonde&#39;s reception of his guests, his manner of
entertaining them, spoke of the hopes he founded in
the protection of the ex-Minister, giving them as a
reason for the necessity of paying court to Don Victoriano.
Leocadia fixed her dog-like look on Segundo&#39;s
countenance.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And the Se&ntilde;ora and the girl&mdash;what are they
like?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Segundo half-closed his eyes the better to contemplate
an attractive and charming image that presented
itself to his mental vision, and to reflect that
in the existence of Nieves he played no part whatsoever,
it being manifest folly for him to think of
Se&ntilde;ora de Comba, who did not think of him. This
reflection, natural and simple enough, aroused his
anger. There was awakened within him a keen
longing for the unattainable, that insensate and unbridled
desire with which the likeness of a beautiful
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page085" id="page085"></a>[pg&nbsp;085]</span>
woman dead for centuries may inspire some dreamer
in a museum.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But answer me&mdash;are those ladies handsome?&quot;
the schoolmistress asked again.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The mother, yes&quot;&mdash;answered Segundo, speaking
with the careless frankness of one who is secure of
his auditor. &quot;Her hair is fair, and her eyes are blue&mdash;a
light blue that makes one think of the verses of
Becquer.&quot; And he began to recite:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&quot;&#39;Tu pupila es azul, y cuando ries</span><br />
<span class="i0">Su claridad suave me recuerda&mdash;&mdash;&#39;&quot;</span><br />
</div></div>

<p class="indent">Leocadia listened to him at first with eyes cast
down; afterward with her face turned away from
him. When he had finished the poem she said in an
altered voice, with feigned calmness.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;They will invite you to go there.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Where?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;To Las Vides, of course. I hear they intend to
have a great deal of company.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes; they have given me a pressing invitation,
but I shall not go. Uncle Clodio insists upon it that
I ought to cultivate the friendship of Don Victoriano
so that he may be of use to me in Madrid and help
me to get a position there. But, child, to go and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page086" id="page086"></a>[pg&nbsp;086]</span>
play a sorry part is not to my liking. This suit is
the best I have, and it is in last year&#39;s fashion. If
they play tresillo or give tips to the servants&mdash;and
it is impossible to make my father understand this&mdash;and
I shall not try to do so: God forbid. So that
they shall not catch a sight of me in Las Vides.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">When she heard what his intentions were, Leocadia&#39;s
countenance cleared up, and rising, radiant
with happiness, she ran to the kitchen. Flores was
washing plates and cups and saucers by the light of
a lamp, knocking them angrily together and rubbing
savagely.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The coffee-pot&mdash;did you clean it?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Presently, presently,&quot; responded the old woman.
&quot;Anyone would think that one was made of wood,
that one is never to get tired&mdash;that one can do things
flying.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Give it to me, I will clean it. Put more wood
on the fire; it is going out and the beefsteak will be
spoiled.&quot; And so saying Leocadia washed the coffee-pot,
cleaning the filter with a knitting-needle,
and put some fresh water down to boil in a new
saucepan, throwing more wood on the fire.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, heap on wood,&quot; growled Flores, &quot;as we get
it for nothing!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Leocadia, who was slicing some potatoes for the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page087" id="page087"></a>[pg&nbsp;087]</span>
beefsteak, paid no attention to her. When she had
cut up as many as she judged necessary, she washed
her hands hastily in the jar of the drain, full of dirty
water, on whose surface floated large patches of
grease. She then hurried to the parlor where Segundo
was waiting for her, and soon afterward Flores
brought in the supper, which they ate, seated at a
small side-table. By the time they had got to the
coffee Segundo began to be more communicative.
This coffee was what Leocadia most prided herself
on. She had bought a set of English china, an imitation
lacquer-box, a <i>vermeil</i> sugar-tongs and two
small silver spoons, and she always placed on the
table with the coffee a liquor-stand, supplied with
cumin, rum, and anisette. At the third glass, of
cumin, seeing the poet amiable and propitious,
Leocadia put her arm around his neck. He drew
back brusquely, noticing with strong repulsion the
odor of cooking and of parsley with which the garments
of the schoolmistress were impregnated.</p>

<p class="indent">At this moment precisely Minguitos, after letting
his shoes drop on the floor, was drawing the coverlet
around him with a sigh. Flores, seated on a low
chair, began to recite the rosary. The sick child required,
to put him to sleep, the monotonous murmur
of the husky voice which had lulled him to rest,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page088" id="page088"></a>[pg&nbsp;088]</span>
ever since his mother had ceased to keep him company
at bedtime. The Ave Marias and Gloria Patris,
mumbled rather than pronounced, little by little
dulled thought and, by the time the litany was
reached, sleep had stolen over him, and, half-unconscious,
it was with difficulty he made the responses
to the barbarous phrases of the old woman: &quot;Juana
celi&mdash;Ora pro nobis&mdash;Sal-es-enfermorun&mdash;nobis&mdash;Refajos
pecadorum&mdash;bis&mdash;Consolate flitorum&mdash;sss&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The only response was the labored, restless, uneven
breathing that came through the sleeping boy&#39;s
half-closed lips. Flores softly put out the tallow
candle, took off her shoes, in order to make no noise,
and stole out gently, feeling her way along the dining-room
wall. From the moment in which Minguitos
fell asleep there was no more rattling of dishes
in the kitchen.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page089" id="page089"></a>[pg&nbsp;089]</span></p>

<h2>VIII.</h2>

<p class="indent">It was late before the Swan blew out the tallow
candle which Aunt G&aacute;spara placed every day, always
with much grumbling, in his brass candlestick.
Seated at the little table littered with books, he had
before him a sheet of paper half covered with lines
of unequal length, variegated with blots and corrections,
little heaps of sand, and here and there a flourish.
Segundo would not have slept all night if he
had not first written down the poem which, from the
moment he had left the cross, had been running
through his brain. Only that, before taking up the
pen, he seemed to have the poem already composed
in his head, so that all he had to do was to turn the
spigot and it would flow out in a stream, and when
he took the pen in his hand the verses, instead of
rushing forth, hid themselves or vanished. A few
strophes fell on the paper, rounded, fluent, finished,
with harmonious and opportune rhymes, with a
certain sweetness and sonorousness extremely delightful
to the author himself, who scribbled them
down hastily before they should take flight. Of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page090" id="page090"></a>[pg&nbsp;090]</span>
others, however, only the first two lines occurred
to him, and, perhaps, the fourth&mdash;this last rounded,
effective; but the third line was wanting and he
must hunt for it, fill up the space, graft on the
syllables to eke out the meter. The poet paused
and looked up at the ceiling, biting the ends of his
mustache, and then the idle pen traced, obeying the
mechanical impulse of the hand, a cocked hat, a
comet, or some other equally irrelevant design.
Sometimes after rejecting seven or eight rhymes he
would content himself with the ninth, which was
neither better nor worse than the others. When a
superfluous syllable would cause a line to halt, he
must look for another adverb, another adjective.
And the accents! If the poet could only enjoy the
privilege, of saying, etern&eacute;l, for instance, instead of
et&eacute;rnel, it would be so easy to write verses!</p>

<p class="indent">Confounded technical difficulties! The divine
fire of inspiration glowed and burned in Segundo&#39;s
mind, but as soon as he tried to transfer it to the
paper, to give expression to what he felt&mdash;to condense,
in words, a world of dreams, a psychic nebula&mdash;his
mind became a blank. To unite the form with
the idea, to imprison feeling in the golden links of
rhyme! Ah, what a light and flowery chain in appearance,
and how hard to weave in reality! How
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page091" id="page091"></a>[pg&nbsp;091]</span>
deceptive the natural grace, the facile harmony of
the master! How easy it seems to express simple,
familiar images, to utter the chimeras of the imagination
and the heart in easy and flowing meter, and
yet how impossible it is, for him who is not called
Becquer, to give his verse those palpitating, diaphanous,
azure wings on which the Becquerian butterfly
soars!</p>

<p class="indent">While the Swan continues his task of effacing and
correcting, Leocadia is in her bedroom, preparing to
retire. On other nights she went to her room with
a smile on her lips, her face glowing, her eyes humid
and half-closed, with deep circles under them, her
hair in disorder. And on those nights she was in no
hurry to retire; she would busy herself arranging the
articles on her bureau, she would even look at herself
in the glass of her cheap toilet table. To-night
her lips were dry, her cheeks pale, she went at once
to bed, loosened her clothing, and let it fall on the
floor, put out the light and buried her face in the
cool, thick cotton sheets. She did not wish to think,
all she wished was to forget and to sleep. She tried
to lie still. A thousand needles seemed to pierce her
flesh; she turned around, in search of a cool spot,
then turned again in search of another, and presently
she threw off the sheets. She felt a horrible restlessness,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page092" id="page092"></a>[pg&nbsp;092]</span>
a savor of bitterness in her mouth. In the
silence of the night she could hear the tumultuous
beating of her heart; if she lay on her left side its
noise almost deafened her. She tried to fix her
thoughts on indifferent subjects, and repeated to herself
with monotonous and persistent regularity&mdash;&quot;To-morrow
is Sunday, the children will not come.&quot;
In vain; her brain boiled, her blood burned as
before. Leocadia was jealous.</p>

<p class="indent">Measureless, nameless torture! Hitherto the poor
schoolmistress had not known the accompaniment of
love, jealousy, whose barbed sting pierces the soul,
whose consuming fire dries up the blood, whose
chill freezes the heart, whose restless anguish makes
the nerves quiver. Segundo scarcely noticed the
young girls of Vilamorta; as for the peasant girls,
they did not exist for him, he did not even regard
them as women; so that Leocadia had attributed
the poet&#39;s hours of coldness to the bad offices of the
muses. But now! She recalled the poem, &quot;A los
ojos azules,&quot; and his manner of reciting it. Those
honeyed verses were to her gall and wormwood.
Tears sprang to her eyes, and she broke into convulsive
sobs which shook her frame and made the bedstead
creak and the cornhusks of the mattress rustle.
Still her overwrought brain did not suspend its
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page093" id="page093"></a>[pg&nbsp;093]</span>
activity. There was not a doubt but that Segundo
was in love with Se&ntilde;ora de Comba; but she was a
married woman. Bah! in Madrid and in novels all
the married women have lovers. And then, who
could resist Segundo, a poet who was the rival of
Becquer, who was young, handsome, ardent, when
he wished to be so?</p>

<p class="indent">What could Leocadia do to avert this great calamity?
Was it not better to resign herself to it? Ah,
resignation, that is easily said! Why had God denied
her the power to express her feelings? Why
had she not knelt before Segundo, begging him for a
little love, describing to him and communicating to
him the flame that consumed the marrow of her
bones? Why had she remained mute when she had
so many things to say? Segundo would not go to
Las Vides; so much the better. He had no money;
better still. He would accept no position, he would
not leave Vilamorta, better and better. But what
did it matter if after all Segundo did not love her;
if he had turned away from her with a gesture which
she could still see in the darkness, or rather in the
lurid light of jealousy.</p>

<p class="indent">How warm the night was! How restless she felt!
She got out of bed and threw herself on the floor,
thinking to find some relief in the coolness of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page094" id="page094"></a>[pg&nbsp;094]</span>
boards. Instead of feeling any alleviation she was
seized with a fit of trembling. A lump seemed to
rise in her throat that prevented her from breathing.
She made an effort to stand up but found that
she was not able; she felt a hysterical attack coming
on, but she tried to restrain her cries, her sobs,
her contortions, in order not to awaken Flores. For
a time she succeeded; but at last the nervous crisis
conquered; her rigid limbs writhed, she dug her nails
into her throat, she rolled about and beat her temples
against the floor. Then a cold perspiration
broke out over her body, and for a moment she lost
consciousness. When she returned to herself she
was calm but exhausted. She rose to her feet, went
back to bed, drew the clothing over her and sank
into a sort of stupor, in which there was neither
thought nor feeling. The beneficent sleep of early
morning had wrapped her senses in oblivion.</p>

<p class="indent">She woke late, unrested, exhausted, and, as it
were, stupefied. She could scarcely manage to dress
herself; it seemed to her as if a year had passed
since the night before, and as for her jealous rage,
her projects of resistance&mdash;how could she have
thought of such things? All that mattered to her,
all she desired, was that Segundo should be happy,
that he should achieve his high destiny, that he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page095" id="page095"></a>[pg&nbsp;095]</span>
should be famous. The rest was madness, a convulsion,
an attack of the nerves to which she
had given way, overcome by the sense of her
loneliness.</p>

<p class="indent">The schoolmistress opened the bureau-drawer in
which she kept her savings and the money for the
household expenses. Beside a pile of stockings was
a slim and flabby purse. A short time ago it had
contained a few thousand reals, all she possessed in
money. Scarcely thirty dollars remained, and out
of these she must pay Cansin for a black merino
dress, the confectioner for liqueurs, and some friends
at Orense for purchases made on her account. And
she would not receive her little income until November.
A brilliant prospect truly!</p>

<p class="indent">After a moment of anguish caused by the struggle
between her economical principles and her resolution,
Leocadia washed her face, smoothed her hair,
put on her dress and her silk manto and left the
house. Being Sunday, the streets were full of people,
and the cracked bell of the chapel kept up an
incessant ringing. The plaza was full of bustle and
animation. Before Do&ntilde;a Eufrasia&#39;s door, three or
four mules, whose clerical riders were in the shop, were
impatiently trying to protect themselves from the
persistent attacks of the flies and hornets, shaking
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page096" id="page096"></a>[pg&nbsp;096]</span>
their heads, stamping their hoofs, and switching their
flanks with their rough tails. And the fruit-venders,
too, in the intervals between selling their wares and
chatting and laughing with one another, were watchful
to chase away the troublesome insects that settled
on the cherries and tomatoes wherever the skin
was broken, leaving uncovered the sweet pulp or the
red flesh. But the grand conclave of the flies was
held in the confectionery of Ramon. It was nauseating
to see the insects buzzing blindly in the hot
atmosphere, entangling their legs in the caramels,
and then making desperate efforts to free themselves
from their sweet captivity. A swarm of flies were
buzzing around a m&eacute;ringue pie which adorned the
center of the shelf, and Ramon having grown tired
of defending it against their attacks, the invading
army rifled it at their pleasure; around the plate lay
the bodies of the flies which had perished in the
attack; some dry and shriveled, others swollen and
with white and livid abdomens.</p>

<p class="indent">Leocadia entered the back shop. Ramon was
there, with his shirt-sleeves rolled up, exposing his
brawny arms, shaking a saucepan gently to cool the
egg-paste which it contained; then he proceeded to
cut the paste with a hot knife, the sugar fizzing and
sending forth a pleasant odor as it came in contact
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page097" id="page097"></a>[pg&nbsp;097]</span>
with the hot metal. The confectioner passed the
back of his hand across his perspiring brow.</p>

<p class="indent">What did Leocadia want? Brizar anisette, eh?
Well, it was all sold. &quot;You, Rosa, isn&#39;t it true that
the anisette is all sold?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The confectioner&#39;s wife was seated in a corner of
the kitchen, feeding a sickly-looking infant. She
fixed her gloomy, morbidly jealous gaze on the
schoolmistress and cried in a harsh voice:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If you come for more anisette, remember the
three bottles that are still unpaid for.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I will pay them now,&quot; answered the schoolmistress,
taking a handful of dollars from her pocket.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Never mind that now, there is no hurry,&quot; stammered
the confectioner, ashamed of his wife&#39;s rudeness.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Take it, Ramon. Why, it was to give it to you
that I came.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If you insist; but the deuce a hurry I was in.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Leocadia hastened away. Not to have remembered
the confectioner&#39;s wife! Who would ask anything
from Ramon before that jealous tigress, who,
small as she was, and sickly as she looked, ruled her
burly husband with a rod of iron. Perhaps Cansin&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">The clothier was displaying his goods to a group
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page098" id="page098"></a>[pg&nbsp;098]</span>
of countrywomen, one of whom persisted in declaring
the bunting she was looking at to be cotton,
rubbing it between her fingers to prove herself in the
right. Cansin, on his side, was rubbing the cloth
with exactly opposite views.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How should it be cotton, woman, how should it
be cotton?&quot; he cried in his shrill voice, putting the
cloth close to the buyer&#39;s face. Cansin appeared so
angry that Leocadia did not venture to address him;
she passed on, quickening her steps. She thought
of her other suitor, the tavern-keeper. But she suddenly
remembered, with a feeling of repulsion, his
thick lips, his cheeks that seemed to drip blood.
Turning over in her mind every possible means by
which she might obtain the money she needed, a
thought occurred to her. She rejected it, she
weighed it, she accepted it. Quickening her pace,
she walked toward the abode of the lawyer Garc&iacute;a.</p>

<p class="indent">At her first knock Aunt G&aacute;spara opened the door.
What a meaning contraction of the brow and lips,
what a sour face greeted her! Leocadia, abashed
and covered with confusion, stood still on the
threshold. The old woman, like a vigilant watch-dog,
barred the entrance, ready to bark or bite at
the first sign of danger.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What did you want?&quot; she growled.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page099" id="page099"></a>[pg&nbsp;099]</span>
&quot;To speak to Don Justo. May I?&quot; said the
schoolmistress humbly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don&#39;t know. I&#39;ll see.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">And the dragon without further ceremony shut
the door in Leocadia&#39;s face. Leocadia waited. At
the end of ten minutes a harsh voice called to her:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Come on!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The heart of the schoolmistress bounded within
her. To go through the house in which Segundo
was born! It was dark and shabby, cold and bare,
like the abode of a miser, in which the furniture is
made to do service until it falls to pieces with old
age. Crossing a hall, Leocadia saw through a half-open
door some garments belonging to Segundo
hanging on a peg, and recognized them with a secret
thrill. At the end of the hall was the lawyer&#39;s
office, an ill-kept, untidy room, full of papers and
dusty and uninteresting-looking books. Aunt G&aacute;spara
withdrew, and Leocadia remained standing
before the lawyer, who, without inviting her to be
seated, said to her with a suspicious and hostile air,
and in the severe tones of a judge:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And what can I do for you, Se&ntilde;ora Do&ntilde;a Leocadia?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">A formula accompanied inwardly by the observation:</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page100" id="page100"></a>[pg&nbsp;100]</span>
&quot;I wager that the scheming schoolmistress has
come to tell me that she is going to marry that crazy
boy and that I shall have to support them both.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Leocadia fixed her dejected gaze on Garc&iacute;a&#39;s face,
trying to discover in his dry and withered features
some resemblance to the features of a beloved countenance.
His face, indeed, resembled Segundo&#39;s in
all but the expression, which was very different;
that of the father&#39;s being as cautious and suspicious
as the son&#39;s was dreamy and abstracted.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Se&ntilde;or Don Justo&mdash;&mdash;&quot; stammered the schoolmistress.
&quot;I am sorry to trouble you. I hope you will
not take this visit amiss&mdash;they told me that you&mdash;&mdash;Se&ntilde;or&mdash;I
need a loan&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Money!&quot; roared the lawyer, clenching his fists.
&quot;You ask me for money!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, Se&ntilde;or, on some property&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ah!&quot; (sudden transition in the lawyer, who became
all softness and amiability). &quot;But how stupid
I am! Come in, come in and sit down, Do&ntilde;a Leocadia.
I hope you are quite well. Why, anyone
might find himself in a difficulty. And what property
is it? Talking together people come to an understanding,
Se&ntilde;ora. Perhaps the vineyard of La
Junqueira, or the other little one, El Adro? Of late
years they have yielded little&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page101" id="page101"></a>[pg&nbsp;101]</span>
The business was discussed and the promissory
note was signed. Aunt G&aacute;spara meanwhile walked
uneasily and with ghost-like tread, up and down the
hall outside. When her brother issued from the
room and gave her some orders she crossed herself
hastily several times on the forehead and the breast.
She then descended stealthily to the cellar, and, after
some little delay, returned and emptied on the lawyer&#39;s
table the contents of her apron, whence rolled
four objects covered with dust and cobwebs, from
which proceeded, as they struck the table, the peculiar
sound produced by coin. These objects were
an earthern savings-bank, a stocking, a leathern sack,
and a little muslin bag.</p>

<p class="indent">That afternoon Leocadia said to Segundo:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do you know what, sweetheart? It is a pity that
for the sake of a new suit or some such trifle you
should lose the chance of establishing yourself and
obtaining what you wish. See, I have a little money
here that I have no particular use for. Do you want
it, eh? I will give it to you now and you can return
it to me by and by.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Segundo drew himself up and, with a genuine outburst
of offended dignity, exclaimed:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Never propose anything like that to me again. I
accept your attentions at times so as not to see you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page102" id="page102"></a>[pg&nbsp;102]</span>
breaking your heart at my refusal, but that you should
clothe me and support me&mdash;no, that is too much.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Half an hour later the schoolmistress renewed
her entreaties affectionately, availing herself of the
opportunity, seeing the Swan somewhat pensive.
Between him and her there ought to be no <i>mine</i> or
<i>thine</i>. Why should he hesitate to accept what it
afforded her so great a pleasure to give? Did her
future by chance depend upon those few paltry dollars?
With them he could present himself decently
at Las Vides, publish his verses, go to Madrid. It
would make her so happy to see him triumph, eclipse
Campoamor, Nu&ntilde;ez de Arce, and all the rest! And
what was there to prevent Segundo from returning
her the money, and with interest, too? Talking
thus, Leocadia filled a handkerchief tied at the four
corners with ounces and <i>doblillos</i> and <i>centenes</i> and
handed it to the poet, saying in a voice rendered
husky by her emotion:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Will you slight me?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Segundi&ntilde;o took the unbeautiful, ungraceful head
of the schoolmistress between his hands, and looking
fixedly in the eyes that looked at him humid with
happiness he said:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Leocadia, I know that you are the one human
being in this world who loves me truly.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page103" id="page103"></a>[pg&nbsp;103]</span>
&quot;Segundi&ntilde;o, my life,&quot; she stammered, beside herself
with happiness, &quot;it isn&#39;t worth mentioning. Just
as I give you that&mdash;as I hope for salvation&mdash;I would
give you the blood from my veins!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">And what would Aunt G&aacute;spara have said had she
known that several of the ounces from the stocking,
the savings-bank, the sack, and the bag would return
immediately, loyal and well-trained, to sleep, if not
under the rafters of the cellar, at least under the
roof of Don Justo?</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page104" id="page104"></a>[pg&nbsp;104]</span></p>

<h2>IX.</h2>

<p class="indent">The grapevine of Las Vides which has such pleasant
recollections for Don Victoriano Andres de la
Comba, bears those large, substantial grapes of the
light red and pale green hues which predominate in
Flemish vineyards, which are known in the neighborhood
by the name of <i>n&aacute;paro</i> or <i>Jaen</i> grapes. Its
clusters hang in long corymbs of a gracefully irregular
shape, half hiding themselves among the thick foliage.
The vine casts a cool shade, and the murmur
of a slender stream of water that falls into a rough
stone basin in which vegetables lie soaking, adds to
the air of peacefulness of the scene.</p>

<p class="indent">The massive building looks almost like a fortress;
the main building is flanked by two square towers,
low-roofed and pierced by deep-set windows; in the
middle of the central building, above a long iron
balcony, stands out the large escutcheon with the
armorial bearings of the Mendez&mdash;five vine-leaves
and a wolf&#39;s head dripping blood. This balcony
commands a view of the mountain slope and of the
river that winds below; at the side of one of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page105" id="page105"></a>[pg&nbsp;105]</span>
towers is a wooden gallery, open to the sun, which
projects over the garden, and where, thanks to the
southern exposure, fine carnations grow luxuriantly
in old pots filled with mold, and wooden boxes overflow
with sweet basil, Santa Teresa&#39;s feathers, cactus,
asclepias, and mallows&mdash;a sun-loving, rich, Arabian
flora of intoxicating sweetness. The interior of the
house is merely a series of whitewashed rooms with
the rafters exposed and almost without furniture,
excepting the central room, called the balcony-room,
which is furnished with chairs with straw seats and
wooden, lyre-shaped backs, of the style of the Empire.
A mirror from which the quicksilver has almost disappeared,
with a broad ebony frame ornamented
with allegorical figures of gilded brass representing
Ph&oelig;bus driving his chariot, hangs above the sofa.
The pride of Las Vides is not the rooms, but the
cellar, the immense wine-vault, dark, and echoing,
and cool as the aisle of a cathedral, with its large vats
ranged in a line on either side. This apartment, unrivaled
in the Border, is the one which Se&ntilde;or de las
Vides shows with most pride&mdash;this and his bedroom,
which has the peculiarity of being impregnable, as it
is built in the body of the wall and can be entered
only through a narrow passage which scarcely affords
room for a man to turn around.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page106" id="page106"></a>[pg&nbsp;106]</span>
Mendez de las Vides resembled in no way the traditional
type of the ignorant lord of the manor who
makes a cross for his signature, a type very common
in that inland country. On the contrary, Mendez
prided himself on being learned and cultured. He
wrote a good hand&mdash;the small, close handwriting
characteristic of obstinate old age; he read well, settling
his spectacles on his nose, holding the newspaper
or the book at a distance, emphasizing the
words in a measured voice. Only his culture was
confined to a single epoch&mdash;that of the Encyclopedists,
with whom his father became acquainted late
in life, and he himself a century after their time.
He read Holbach, Rousseau, Voltaire, and the fourteen
volumes of Feij&oacute;o. He bore the stamp and
seal of this epoch even in his person. In religion he
was a deist, never neglecting, however, to go to mass
and to eat fish in Holy Week; in politics he was
inclined to uphold the prerogatives of the crown
against the church. Since the arrival of Don Victoriano,
however, some movement had taken place in
the stratified ideas of the hidalgo of Las Vides. He
admired English independence, the regard paid to
the right of the individual combined with a respect
for tradition and the civilizing influence of the aristocratic
classes&mdash;a series of Saxon importations more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page107" id="page107"></a>[pg&nbsp;107]</span>
or less felicitous but to which Don Victoriano owed
his political success. Uncle and nephew spent hour
after hour discussing these abstruse problems of
social science, while Nieves worked, listening with
the hope of hearing the trot of some horse sound on
the stones of the path announcing some visitor,
some distraction in her idle existence.</p>

<p class="indent">To make the journey to Las Vides, Segundo borrowed
the vicious nag of the alguazil. From the
cross onward the road grew precipitous and difficult.
Smooth, slippery rocks obstructed the way at times,
so that the rider was obliged to hold a tight rein to
keep the animal, whose hoofs slipped continually,
drawing sparks from the stone, from falling headlong
down the descent. The ground, parched by the
heat, was rugged and uneven. The houses seemed
to cling to the mountain-side, threatening to lose
their hold at every moment and topple over into the
river, and the indispensable pot of carnations, whose
flowers peeped through the rails of the wooden balconies,
reminded one of the flower with which a
gypsy carelessly adorns her hair. Sometimes Segundo&#39;s
way led through a pine grove, and he inhaled
the balsamic odor of the resin and rode over a
carpet of dry leaves which deadened the sound of
his horse&#39;s hoofs; suddenly, between two fences, a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page108" id="page108"></a>[pg&nbsp;108]</span>
narrow path, bordered by blackberry bushes, foxglove
and honeysuckle would open before him, and
not unfrequently he experienced the delightful sense
of well-being produced by the coolness cast by umbrageous
foliage during the heat of the day, as he
rode through some verdant tunnel&mdash;under some
lofty grape arbor supported on wooden posts, beholding
above his head the bunches already ripening,
and listening to the noisy twittering of the sparrows
and the shrill whistle of the blackbird. Lizards ran
along the moss-covered walls. When two or more
paths met Segundo would rein in his horse, to inquire
the way to Las Vides of the women who toiled
wearily up the steep path, bending under their load
of pine wood, or the children playing at the doors of
the houses.</p>

<p class="indent">Far below ran the Avieiro, that, from the height at
which Segundo regarded it, looked like a steel blade
flashing and quivering in the sunshine. Before him
was the mountain where, like the steps of a colossal
amphitheater, rose one above another massive walls
of whitish stone, erected for the support of the grapevines,
the white stripes showing against the green
background, forming an odd combination in which
stood out here and there the red roof of some dovecote
or some old homestead, the whole surmounted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page109" id="page109"></a>[pg&nbsp;109]</span>
by the darker green of the pine woods. Segundo at
last saw below him the tiles of Las Vides. He descended
a steep slope and found himself before the
portico.</p>

<p class="indent">Under the grapevine were Victorina and Nieves.
The child was amusing herself jumping the rope,
which she did with extraordinary agility, the feet
close together, without moving from one spot, the
rope turning so rapidly that the graceful form of the
jumper seemed to be enveloped in a sort of mist.
Through the interstices in the foliage of the grapevine
came large splashes of sunshine suddenly flooding
the girl&#39;s form with light, in which her hair, her
arms and her bare legs gleamed, for she wore only a
loose navy blue blouse without sleeves. When she
caught sight of Segundo she gave a little cry,
dropped the rope and disappeared. Nieves, to make
amends, rose from the bench where she had been
working, with a smile on her lips and a slight flush
of surprise on her cheeks, and extended her hand to
the newcomer, who made haste to dismount from
his horse.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And Se&ntilde;or Don Victoriano, how is he?&quot; he
asked.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, he is somewhere in the neighborhood; he is
very well, and very much interested in the labors of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page110" id="page110"></a>[pg&nbsp;110]</span>
the country&mdash;very contented.&quot; Nieves said these
words with the abstracted air with which we speak
of things that possess only a slight interest for us.
Segundo observed that the glance of the Minister&#39;s
wife rested on his fine suit, which he had just received
from Orense; and the idea that she might
think it pretentious or ridiculous disturbed him so
greatly for a time that he regretted not having worn
his ordinary clothes.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You frightened away Victorina,&quot; continued
Nieves, smiling. &quot;Where can the silly child have
disappeared to? No doubt she ran away because
she had on only a blouse. You treat her like a
woman, and she is growing unbearable. Come.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Nieves gathered up the skirt of her morning gown
of white cretonne spotted with rosebuds, and made
her way intrepidly into the kitchen, which was on a
level with the yard. Following the little Louis XV.
heels covered by the Breton lace of her petticoat,
Segundo passed through several rooms&mdash;the kitchen,
the dining-room, the Rosary room, so called because
in it Primo Genday said prayers with the servants,
and finally the balcony room. Here Nieves stopped,
saying:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I will call to them if they chance to be in the
vineyard.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page111" id="page111"></a>[pg&nbsp;111]</span>
And leaning out of the window, she cried:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Uncle! Victoriano! Uncle!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Two voices responded.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What is it? We are coming.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Finding nothing opportune to say, Segundo was
silent. Her conscience at rest, now that she had
called the elders, Nieves turned toward him and
said, with the graciousness of a hostess who knows
what are the duties of her position:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How good this is of you! We had not thought
you would care to come before the vintage. And
now that the holidays are approaching&mdash;indeed I
supposed we should see you in Vilamorta before seeing
you here, as Victoriano has determined to take
a fortnight&#39;s course of the waters.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She leaned against the wall as she spoke, and
Segundo tapped the toe of his boot with his whip.
From the garden came the voice of Mendez:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Nieves! Nieves! Come down, if it is all the
same to you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Excuse me, I am going for a parasol.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She soon returned, and Segundo offered her his
arm. They descended into the garden through the
gallery, and after the customary greetings were over
Mendez protested against Segundo&#39;s returning that
afternoon to Vilamorta.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page112" id="page112"></a>[pg&nbsp;112]</span>
&quot;The idea! A pretty thing that would be! To
expose yourself to the heat twice in the same day!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">And Se&ntilde;or de las Vides, availing himself of an
opportunity which no rural proprietor ever lets slip,
took possession of the poet and gave himself up to
the task of showing him over the estate. He explained
to him at the same time his viticultural
enterprises. He had been among the first to employ
sulphur fumigation with success, and he was
now using new manures which would perhaps solve
the problem of grape cultivation. He was making
experiments with the common wine of the Border,
trying to make with it an imitation of the rich Bordeaux;
to impart to it, with powdered lily-root, the
bouquet, the fragrance, of the French wines. But
he had to contend against the spirit of routine,
fanaticism, as he said, confidentially lowering his
voice and laying his hand on Segundo&#39;s shoulder.
The other vine-growers accused him of disregarding
the wholesome traditions of the country, of adulterating
and making up wine. As if they themselves
did not make it up. Only that they did so, using
common drugs for the purpose&mdash;logwood and nightshade.
He contented himself with employing
rational methods, scientific discoveries, the improvements
of modern chemistry, condemning the absurd
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page113" id="page113"></a>[pg&nbsp;113]</span>
custom of using pitch in the skins, for although the
people of the Border approved of the taste of pitch in
the wine, saying that the pitch excited thirst, the
exporters disliked, and with reason, the stickiness
imparted by it. In short, if Segundo would like to
see the wine vaults and the presses&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">There was no help for it. Nieves remained at the
door, fearing to soil her dress. When they came out
they proceeded to inspect the garden in detail. The
garden, too, was a series of walls built one above another,
like the steps of a stairs, sustaining narrow
belts of earth, and this arrangement of the ground
gave the vegetation an exuberance that was almost
tropical. Camellias, peach trees, and lemon trees
grew in wild luxuriance, laden at once with leaves,
fruits, and blossoms. Bees and butterflies circled
and hummed around them, sipping their sweets, wild
with the joy of mere existence and drunken with the
sunshine. They ascended by steep steps from wall
to wall. Segundo gave his arm to Nieves and at the
last step they paused to look at the river flowing
below.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Look there,&quot; said Segundo, pointing to a distant
hill on his left. &quot;There is the pine grove. I wager
you have forgotten.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page114" id="page114"></a>[pg&nbsp;114]</span>
&quot;I have not forgotten,&quot; responded Nieves, winking
her blue eyes dazzled by the sun; &quot;the pine
grove that sings. You see that I have not forgotten.
And tell me, do you know if it will sing to-day? For
I should greatly like to hear it sing this afternoon.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If a breeze rises. With the air as still as it is
now, the pines will be almost motionless and almost
silent. And I say <i>almost</i>, for they are never quite
silent. The friction of their tops is sufficient to
cause a peculiar vibration, to produce a murmur&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And does that happen,&quot; asked Nieves jestingly,
&quot;only with the pines here or is it the same with all
pines?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I cannot say,&quot; answered Segundo, looking at her
fixedly. &quot;Perhaps the only pine grove that will ever
sing for me will be that of Las Vides.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Nieves lowered her eyes, and then glanced round,
as if in search of Don Victoriano and Mendez, who
were on one of the steps above them. Segundo
observed the movement and with rude imperiousness
said to Nieves:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Let us join them.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">They rejoined their companions and did not again
separate from them until they entered the dining-room,
where Genday and Tropiezo were awaiting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page115" id="page115"></a>[pg&nbsp;115]</span>
them. The last to arrive was the child, now modestly
attired in a piqu&eacute; frock and long stockings.</p>

<p class="indent">The table at which they dined was placed, not in
the center, but at one side of the dining-room; it
was square and at the sides, instead of chairs, stood
two oaken benches, dark with age, as seats for the
guests. The head and foot of the table were left
free for the service. Sober by nature, Segundo
noticed with surprise the extraordinary quantity of
food consumed by Don Victoriano, observing at the
same time that his face was thinner than before.
Now and then the statesman paused remorsefully,
saying:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am eating ravenously.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The Amphitryon protested, and Tropiezo and
Genday expounded in turn liberal and consoling doctrines.
&quot;Nature is very wise,&quot; said Se&ntilde;or de las Vides,
who had not forgotten Rousseau, &quot;and he who obeys
her cannot go astray.&quot; Primo Genday, fond of eating,
like all plethoric people, added with a certain
theological unction: &quot;In order that the soul may be
disposed to serve God the reasonable requirements of
the body must first be attended to.&quot; Tropiezo, on
his side, pushed out his lower lip, denying the existence
of certain new-fangled diseases. Since the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page116" id="page116"></a>[pg&nbsp;116]</span>
world began there had been people who suffered as
Don Victoriano was suffering and no one had ever
thought of depriving them of eating and drinking,
quite the contrary. For the very reason that the
disease was a wasting one it was necessary to eat
well. Don Victoriano allowed himself to be easily
persuaded. Those dishes of former times, those
antiquated, miraculous cruet-stands in which the oil
and the vinegar came from the same tube without
ever mingling, that immense loaf placed on the table
as a center-piece, were for him so many delightful
relics of the past, which reminded him of happy
hours, the irresponsible years of existence. At the
dessert, when Primo Genday, still heated with a political
discussion in which he had characterized the
liberals as uncircumcised, suddenly grew very serious
and proceeded to recite the Lord&#39;s Prayer, the Minister,
a confirmed rationalist, was surprised at the
devoutness with which he murmured&mdash;&quot;Our daily
bread.&quot; <i>Caramba</i>, those memories of the days when
one was young! Don Victoriano grew young again
in going over those recollections of his boyish days.
He even called to mind ephemeral engagements, flirtations
of a fortnight with young ladies of the Border
who, at the present time, must be withered old
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page117" id="page117"></a>[pg&nbsp;117]</span>
maids or respectable mothers of families. A pretty
fool he was! The ex-Minister laid down his napkin
and rose to his feet.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do you sleep the siesta?&quot; he asked Segundo.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, Se&ntilde;or.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Nor I either; let us go and smoke a cigar
together.&quot;</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page118" id="page118"></a>[pg&nbsp;118]</span></p>

<h2>X.</h2>

<p class="indent">They seated themselves near the window in the
parlor in a couple of rocking-chairs brought from
Orense. The garden and the vineyard breathed a
lazy tranquillity, a silence so profound that the dull
sound of the ripe peaches breaking from the branch
and falling on the dry ground could be plainly
heard. Through the open window came odors of
fruit and honey. In the house unbroken silence
reigned.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Will you have a cigar?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Thanks.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The cigars were lighted and Segundo, following
Don Victoriano&#39;s example, began to rock himself.
The rhythmical movement of the rocking-chairs, the
drowsy quiet of the place, invited to a serious and
confidential conversation.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And you, what do you do in Vilamorta? You
are a lawyer, are you not. I think I have heard that
it is your intention to succeed your father in his
practice&mdash;a very intelligent man.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Segundo felt that the occasion was propitious.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page119" id="page119"></a>[pg&nbsp;119]</span>
The smoke of the cigars, diffusing itself through the
atmosphere, softened the light, disposing him to
confidence and dispelling his habitual reserve.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The thought of beginning now the career my
father is just ending horrifies me,&quot; he said, in answer
to the ex-Minister&#39;s question. &quot;That sordid struggle
to gain a little money, more or less, those village
intrigues, that miserable plotting and planning, that
drawing-up of documents&mdash;I was made for none of
those things, Se&ntilde;or Don Victoriano. It is not that
I could not practice. I have been a fair student and
my good memory always brought me safely through
in the examinations. But for what does the profession
of law serve? For a foundation, nothing more.
It is a passport, a card of admission to some office.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well&mdash;&mdash;&quot; said Don Victoriano, shaking the ashes
from his cigar, &quot;what you say is true, very true. What
is learned at the University is of scarcely any use
afterward. As for me, if it had not been for my
apprenticeship with Don Juan Antonio Prado, who
taught me to make a practical use of my legal
knowledge and to know how many teeth there are
in a comb, I should not have distinguished myself
greatly by my Compostelan learning. My friend,
what makes a man of one, what really profits one is
this terrible apprenticeship, the position in which a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page120" id="page120"></a>[pg&nbsp;120]</span>
boy finds himself when a pile of papers is set before
him, and a pompous gentleman says to him, &#39;Study
this question to-day and have ready for me by to-morrow
a formulated opinion on it.&#39; There is the
rub! That is what makes you sweat and bite your
nails! There neither laziness nor ignorance will
avail you. The thing must be done, and as it cannot
be done by magic&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Even in Madrid and on a large scale the practice
of the law has no attractions for me. I have
other aspirations.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Let us hear what they are.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Segundo hesitated, restrained by a feeling of shyness,
as if he had been going to narrate a dream or
to descant on the delights of love. He followed
with his eyes for a few moments the blue smoke
curling upward and finally, the semi-obscurity of the
room, secluded as a confessional, dissipated his reserve.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I wish to follow the profession of literature,&quot; he
returned.</p>

<p class="indent">The statesman stopped rocking himself and took
his cigar from his mouth.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But my boy, literature is not a profession!&quot; he
said. &quot;There is no such thing as the profession of
literature! Let us understand each other&mdash;have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page121" id="page121"></a>[pg&nbsp;121]</span>
you ever been out of Vilamorta? I mean beyond
Santiago and the neighboring towns?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, Se&ntilde;or.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then I can understand those illusions and those
childish notions. They still believe here that a
writer or a poet, from the mere fact of his being
such, may aspire to&mdash;and what do you write?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Poetry.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You don&#39;t write prose at all?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;An occasional essay or newspaper article. Very
little.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Bravo! Well, if you trust to poetry to make
your way in the world&mdash;I have remarked something
curious in this place and I am going to tell you what
it is. Verses are still read here with interest, and it
seems the girls learn them by heart. But in the
capital I assure you there is scarcely anyone who
cares for poetry. You are twenty or thirty years
behind the age here&mdash;at the height of the romantic
period.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Segundo, annoyed, said with some vehemence:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And Campoamor? And Nu&ntilde;ez de Arce? And
Grilo? Are they not famous poets? Are they not
popular?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Campoamor? They read him because he is very
witty, and he sets the girls thinking and he makes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page122" id="page122"></a>[pg&nbsp;122]</span>
the men laugh. He has his merit, and he amuses
while he philosophizes. But remember that neither
he nor Nu&ntilde;ez de Arce lives by writing verses.
Much prosperity that would bring them! As to
Grilo&mdash;well, he has his admirers among ladies of
rank, and the Queen Mother publishes his poems,
and as far as we can judge he has plenty of money.
But convince yourself that no one will ever grow
rich by following the road that leads to Parnassus.
And this is when masters are in question, for of
poets of a secondary rank, young men who string
rhymes together with more or less facility, there are
probably now in Madrid some two or three hundred.
Have you ever heard of any of them? No;
nor I either. A few friends praise them when they
publish anything in some insignificant review. But
there is no need to go on. In plain words, it is time
lost.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Segundo silently vented his anger on his cigar.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Don&#39;t take what I say as an offense,&quot; continued
Don Victoriano. &quot;I know little about literature,
although in my youthful days I wrote <i>quintillas</i>,
like everybody else. Besides, I have seen nothing
of what you have written, so that my opinion is
impartial and my advice sincere.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My ambition,&quot; began Segundo at last, &quot;is not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page123" id="page123"></a>[pg&nbsp;123]</span>
confined exclusively to lyric poetry. Perhaps later
I might prefer the drama&mdash;or prose. Who knows?
I only want to try my fortune.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Don Victoriano rose and stepped out into the balcony.
Suddenly he returned, placed both hands on
Segundo&#39;s shoulders, and putting his clean-shaven
face close to the face of the poet, said with a pity
which was not feigned:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Poor boy! How many, many disappointments
are in store for you!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">And as Segundo, astonished at this sudden
effusion, remained silent, he continued:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Novice as you are, you have no means of knowing
what you are doing. I am sorry for you. You
are deluding yourself. In the present state of society,
in order to attain eminence in anything, you
must sweat blood like Christ in the garden of Gethsemane.
If it is lyric poetry that is in question,
God help you! If you write comedies or farces,
you have an enviable fate before you&mdash;to flatter the
actors, to have your manuscript lie neglected in the
corner of a drawer, to have half an act cut out at a
stroke; and then the dread of the first night, and of
what comes after it&mdash;which may be the worst of all.
If you become a journalist, you will not have ten
minutes in the day to yourself, you will make the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page124" id="page124"></a>[pg&nbsp;124]</span>
reputation of others, and you will never see even so
much as the shadow of your own. If you write
books&mdash;but who reads in Spain? And if you throw
yourself into politics&mdash;ah, then indeed!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Segundo, his eyes cast down, his gaze wandering
over the pine knots in the boarded floor, listened
without opening his lips to those convincing accents
that seemed to tear away one by one the rose-leaves
of his illusions, with the same strident sound with
which the nail of the speaker flicked away the ash of
his cigar. At last he raised his contracted face and
looking at the statesman said, not without a touch
of sarcasm in his voice:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;As for politics, Se&ntilde;or Don Victoriano, it seems
to me that you ought not to speak ill of that. It
has treated you well; you have no cause of complaint
against it. For you politics has not been a
stepmother.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Don Victoriano&#39;s countenance changed, showing
plainly the ravages disease had made in his organism;
and rising to his feet a second time, he threw
away his cigar and, walking up and down the room
with hasty steps, he burst forth passionately, in
words that rushed from his lips in a sudden flood, in
an impetuous and unequal stream, like the stream of
blood gushing from a severed artery:</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page125" id="page125"></a>[pg&nbsp;125]</span>
&quot;Don&#39;t touch that point. Be silent about that,
boy. How do you, how does anybody know what
those things are until he has thrown himself headlong
into them and is caught fast and cannot escape!
If I were to tell you&mdash;but it is impossible to tell
one&#39;s whole life, day by day, to describe a battle
which has lasted for years, without rest or respite.
To struggle in order to make one&#39;s self known, to
go on struggling to keep one&#39;s self from being forgotten,
to pass from law to politics, from a wheel
set with knives to a bed of live coals, to fight in
Congress without faith, without conviction, because
one must fight to keep the place one has won; and
with all this not to have a free hour, not a tranquil
moment, not have time for anything. One achieves
fortune when one no longer has the inclination to
enjoy it; one marries and has a family and&mdash;one has
hardly liberty to accompany one&#39;s wife to the
theater. Don&#39;t talk to me. A hell, a hell upon
earth is what politics is. Would you believe&quot; (and
here he uttered a round oath) &quot;that when my little
girl was beginning to walk, I proposed to myself one
day to have the pleasure of taking her out walking&mdash;a
caprice, a whim. Well, I was going downstairs
with the child in my arms, very contented,
when lo, I found myself face to face with the Marquis
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page126" id="page126"></a>[pg&nbsp;126]</span>
of Cameros, a candidate for representative from
Galicia, who had come to ask me for fifteen or
twenty letters&mdash;written in my own hand so that they
might prove more efficacious. And I was such a
fool, man, I was such a fool, that instead of throwing
the Marquis down the stairs, as I ought to have
done, I walked back my two flights, gave the child
to her nurse, and shut myself up in my office
to prepare the election. And it was the
same thing always; tell me, then, have I reason
or not to abominate such folly, such humbug?
Ah, what pains we are at to make ourselves
miserable!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">There could be no doubt of it; in the voice of the
statesman there was the sound of repressed tears;
in his throat smothered curses and blasphemies
struggled for utterance. Segundo, to do something,
threw open the window leading to the balcony.
The sun was low in the heavens; the heat had grown
less intense.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And worst of all&mdash;the consequences!&quot; continued
Don Victoriano, pausing in his walk. &quot;You strive
and struggle without pausing to reflect what will be
the effect upon your health. You fight, like the
knights of old, with visor down. But as you are not
made of iron, but only of flesh and blood, when you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page127" id="page127"></a>[pg&nbsp;127]</span>
least expect it, you find yourself sick, sick, wounded,
without knowing where. You do not lose blood,
but you lose the sap of life, like a lemon that is
squeezed.&quot; And the ex-Minister laughed bitterly.
&quot;And you want to stop, to rest, to get back health at
any cost, and you find that it is too late; you have
not a drop of moisture left in your body. Well,
keep on until there is an end to you. Much your
labors and your triumphs have profited you! You
have drawn down on yourself a doom from which
there is no escape!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He spoke with gesticulations, thrusting his hands
into his trousers pockets in an outburst of confidence,
expressing himself with as little reserve as if
he had been alone. And in reality he was talking
to himself. His words were a monologue, the spoken
utterance of the gloomy thoughts which Don Victoriano,
thanks to heroic efforts, had hitherto been
able to conceal in his own breast. The strange
malady from which he suffered gave rise to horrible
nightmares; he dreamed that he was turning into a
loaf of sugar and that his intellect, his blood, his life,
were flowing away from him, through a deep, deep
channel, converted into syrup. In his waking moments
his mind refused to accept, as one refused to
accept a humiliation, so strange a malady. Sanchez
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page128" id="page128"></a>[pg&nbsp;128]</span>
del Abrojo must be mistaken; his was some functional,
transitory disorder, an ordinary ailment, the
result of his sedentary life, and Tropiezo&#39;s old-fashioned
remedies would perhaps after all prove more
efficacious than those of science. And if they did
not? The statesman felt a cold chill run through
him that made his hair stand on end and constricted
his heart. To die when he was scarcely past forty,
with his mental powers unimpaired, with so many
things begun, so many accomplished! And no
doubt this consuming thirst, this insatiable voracity,
this debilitating sensation of melting away, of fusion,
of dissolving, were all fatal symptoms.</p>

<p class="indent">Suddenly Don Victoriano remembered the presence
of Segundo, which he had almost forgotten.
And laying both hands on his shoulders a second
time, and fixing on the poet&#39;s eyes, his dry eyes,
scorched by repressed tears, he cried:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do you wish to hear the truth, and to receive
good advice? Have you ambitions, aspirations,
hopes? Well, I have had disappointments, and I
desire to do you a service by recounting them to
you now. Don&#39;t be a fool; stay here all your life;
help your father, take up his practice when he lays
it down, and marry that blooming daughter of
Agonde. Never leave this land of fruits, of vines,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page129" id="page129"></a>[pg&nbsp;129]</span>
whose climate is so delightful. What would I not
give now never to have left it! No, my boy, remain
quietly here; end a long life here surrounded by
a numerous progeny. Have you observed how
healthy your father is? It is a pleasure to see him,
with his teeth so sound and perfect. I have not a
single tooth that is not decayed; they say that it is
one of the symptoms of my malady. Why, if your
mother were living now you would be having little
brothers and sisters.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Segundo smiled.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But, Se&ntilde;or Don Victoriano,&quot; he said, &quot;to act out
your ideas would be to vegetate, not to live.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And what greater happiness than to vegetate,&quot;
responded the statesman, looking out of the window.
&quot;Do you think those trees there are not to
be envied?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The garden, indeed, seen in the light of the setting
sun, had a certain air of voluptuous bliss, as if it
were enjoying a happy dream.</p>

<p class="indent">The lustrous leaves of the lemon trees and the
camellias, the gummy trunks of the fruit trees,
seemed to drink in with delight the fresh evening
breeze, precursor of the vivifying dews of night.
The golden atmosphere took on in the distance faint
lilac tints. Innumerable noises began to make themselves
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page130" id="page130"></a>[pg&nbsp;130]</span>
heard, preludes to songs of insects, to the concerts
of the frogs and toads.</p>

<p class="indent">The pensive tranquillity of the scene was broken
in upon by the quick trot of a mule, and Clodio Genday,
out of breath, flung himself out of his saddle,
and reeled into the garden. Gesticulating with his
hands, with his head, with his whole body, he called,
screamed, vociferated:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, I have a nice piece of news for you, a nice
piece of news! I will be there directly, I will be
there directly!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">They went to the head of the stairs leading to
the garden, to meet him, and when he rushed upon
them, like an arrow shot from a bow, they saw that
he wore neither collar nor cravat, and that his dress
was in the utmost disorder.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;A mere bagatelle, Se&ntilde;or Don Victoriano&mdash;that
they are playing a trick upon us; that they have
played it already, that unless we take prompt measures
we shall lose the district. You would not believe
it, if I were to tell you of all the plans they
have been laying, for a long time past, at Do&ntilde;a Eufrasia&#39;s
shop. And we simpletons suspecting nothing.
And all the priests are in the plot; the parish
priests of Lubrego, of Boan, of Naya, and of Cebre.
They have set up as a candidate Se&ntilde;orito de Romero
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page131" id="page131"></a>[pg&nbsp;131]</span>
of Orense, who is willing to loosen his purse-strings.
But where is Primo, that good-for-nothing, that scarecrow,
who never found out a word of all this?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We will look for him, man. What do you tell
me, what do you tell me? I never thought they
would have dared&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">And Don Victoriano, animated and excited, followed
Clodio, who went shouting through the parlor:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Primo! Primo!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">A little later Segundo saw the two brothers and
the ex-Minister going through the garden disputing
and gesticulating violently. Clodio was making
charges against Primo, who tried to defend himself,
while Don Victoriano acted as peacemaker. In his
fury Clodio shook his clenched fist in Primo&#39;s face,
almost laying violent hands upon him, while the culprit
stammered, crossing himself hastily:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Mercy, mercy, mercy! Ave Maria!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The poet watched them as they passed by, remarking
the transformation that had taken place in Don
Victoriano. As he turned away from the window
he saw Nieves standing before him.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And those gentlemen,&quot; she said to him graciously,
&quot;have they left you all alone? The pines
must at this time be singing. There is a breeze stirring.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page132" id="page132"></a>[pg&nbsp;132]</span>
&quot;Undoubtedly they will be singing now,&quot; returned
the poet. &quot;I shall hear them as I ride back to Vilamorta.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Nieves&#39; movement of surprise did not pass unnoticed
by Segundo, who, looking her steadily in the
face, added coldly and proudly: &quot;Unless you should
command me to remain.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Nieves was silent. She felt that courtesy required
that she should make some effort to detain her
guest, while at the same time to ask him to remain,
they two being alone, seemed to her inexpedient
and liable to misconstruction. At last she took a
middle course, saying with a forced smile:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But why are you in such a hurry? And will you
make us another visit?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We shall see each other later in Vilamorta.
Good-by, Nieves, I will not disturb Don Victoriano.
Say good-by to him for me and tell him he
may count upon my father&#39;s services and upon
mine.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Without taking Nieves&#39; outstretched hand or looking
at her he descended into the courtyard. He
was settling his feet in the stirrups when he saw a
little figure appear close beside him. It was Victorina,
with her hands full of lumps of sugar, which
she offered the nag. The animal eagerly pushed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page133" id="page133"></a>[pg&nbsp;133]</span>
out its under lip, which moved with the intelligent
undulations of an elephant&#39;s trunk.</p>

<p class="indent">Segundo interposed:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Child, he will bite you; he bites.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Then he added gayly:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do you want me to lift you up here? You
don&#39;t? I wager I can lift you!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He lifted her up and seated her on the saddle-cloth,
before him. She struggled to free herself and
in her struggles her beautiful hair fell over the face
and shoulders of Segundo, who was holding her
tightly around the waist. He observed with some
surprise that the girl&#39;s heart was beating tumultuously.
Turning very pale Victorina cried:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Mamma, mamma!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">At last she succeeded in releasing herself and ran
toward Nieves, who was laughing merrily at the incident.
Half-way she stopped, retraced her steps,
threw her arms around the horse&#39;s neck and pressed
on his nose a warm kiss.</p>

<h2>XI.</h2>

<p class="indent">Eight or ten days intervened between Segundo&#39;s
visit to Las Vides and the return of Don Victoriano
and his family to Vilamorta. Don Victoriano desired
to drink the waters and at the same time to
take measures to frustrate the dark machinations of
Romero&#39;s partisans. His plan was a simple one&mdash;to
offer Romero some other district, where he would
not have to spend a penny, and thus removing the
only rival who had any prestige in the country he
would avoid the mortification of a defeat through
Vilamorta. It was important to do this before October,
the period at which the electoral contest was to
take place. And while Genday, Garc&iacute;a, the Alcalde
and the other Combistas managed the negotiation,
Don Victoriano, installed in Agonde&#39;s house, drank
two or three glasses of the salubrious waters every
morning, after which he read his correspondence, and
in the afternoon, when the sultry heat invited to a
siesta, he read or wrote in the cool parlor of the
apothecary.</p>

<p class="indent">Segundo frequently accompanied him in these
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page135" id="page135"></a>[pg&nbsp;135]</span>
hours of retirement. They talked together like two
friends, and the statesman, far from insisting on the
ideas he had expressed in Las Vides, encouraged the
poet, offering him to endeavor to obtain a position
for him in Madrid which should enable him to carry
out his plans.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;A position that will not take up much of your
time, nor require much mental labor&mdash;I will see, I
will see. I will be on the lookout for something.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Segundo observed unmistakable signs of improved
health in the wrinkled face of the Minister. Don
Victoriano was experiencing the transitory benefit
which mineral waters produce at first, stimulating
the organism only to waste it all the more rapidly,
perhaps, afterward. Both digestion and circulation
had become more active, and perspiration, even,
entirely suppressed by the disease, had become re-established,
dilating the pores with grateful warmth
and communicating to the dry fibers the elasticity
of healthy flesh. As a candle flares up brightly before
going out, so Don Victoriano seemed to be
recovering strength when in reality he was wasting
away. Fancying health was returning to him, he
breathed with delight the narrow atmosphere of
party intrigues, taking pleasure in disputing his district
inch by inch, in winning over adherents and receiving
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page136" id="page136"></a>[pg&nbsp;136]</span>
demonstrations of sympathy, and secretly
flattered by the absurd proposal made by his parishioners
to the parish priest of Vilamorta, that incense
should be burned before him. In the evening he
amused himself patriarchally among Agonde&#39;s visitors,
listening to the comical stories told of the
clique at Do&ntilde;a Eufrasia&#39;s shop and enjoying the ripple
of excitement occasioned by the proximity of
the feasts. Little by little the innocent tresillo
table of Agonde had become transformed into something
much more wicked. Now, instead of four
persons being seated at it, there was only one,
around whom, their eyes fixed on his hands, the
others stood grouped. The banker&#39;s left hand
grasped the cards tightly while with the ball of his
thumb he pushed up the last card until first the spot
could be descried, then the number, then the knob of
a club, the point of a diamond, the blue tail of a
horse, the turreted crown of a king, and other hands
took up stakes or took money from the pocket and
laid it down on the fateful pieces of cardboard with
the words:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;On the seven! On the four! The ace is in
sight!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Through respect for Don Victoriano, Agonde refrained
from dealing the cards when the latter was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page137" id="page137"></a>[pg&nbsp;137]</span>
present, bridling with difficulty the only passion that
could warm his blood and excite his placid nature,
giving up his place to Jacinto Ruedas, a famous
strolling gambler, known everywhere, who followed
the scent of the gaming-table as others follow the
scent of a banquet, a rare type, something between
a swindler and a spy, who made low jests in a hoarse
voice. The chroniclers do not state whether the
civil authorities, that is to say, the judge of Vilamorta,
made any attempt to interfere with the unlawful
diversion in which the visitors to the pharmacy
indulged, but it is an ascertained fact that, the
judge having one leg shorter than the other, the
pounding of his crutch on the sidewalk gave timely
warning of his approach to the players. And as for
the municipal authority, it is known to a certainty
that one day, or to speak with more exactness, one
night, he entered the apothecary&#39;s back shop like
a bomb, holding in his hand money which he threw
on a card, crying:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Gentlemen, I am queen!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Be an ass, if you like!&quot; responded Agonde, pushing
him away with marked disrespect.</p>

<p class="indent">This year Don Victoriano&#39;s presence and the open
hostilities waged between his partisans and those of
Romero gave a martial character to the feasts. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page138" id="page138"></a>[pg&nbsp;138]</span>
Combists desired to render them more splendid and
brilliant than ever before and the Romerists to render
them a failure, as far as it was possible. In the
main room of the townhall the monster balloon,
which occupied the whole length of the apartment,
was being repaired; its white sides were being covered
with inscriptions, figures, emblems, and symbols,
and around the floor were scattered tin kettles filled
with paste, pots of vermilion, Sienna, and ochre,
balls of packthread and cut paper figures. From
the giant balloon sprung daily broods of smaller balloons,
miniature balloons, made with remnants and
fancifully decorated in pink and blue. At the meetings
at Do&ntilde;a Eufrasia&#39;s they spoke contemptuously
of these preparations and commented on the audacity
of the inn-keeper&#39;s son, a mere dauber, who
undertook to paint Don Victoriano&#39;s likeness on one
of the divisions of the large balloon. The Romerist
young ladies, compressing their lips and shrugging
their shoulders, declared that they would attend
neither the fire-works nor the ball, not if their adversaries
were to offer novenas with that purpose to
every saint in heaven.</p>

<p class="indent">On the other hand, the young ladies of the Combist
party formed a sort of court around Nieves.
Every afternoon they called for her to take her out
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page139" id="page139"></a>[pg&nbsp;139]</span>
walking; chief among these were Carmen Agonde,
Florentina, the daughter of the Alcalde, Rosa, a
niece of Tropiezo, and Clara, the eldest of Garc&iacute;a&#39;s
daughters. This latter was running about barefooted,
spending her time gathering blackberries in
her apron, when she received the astounding news
that her father had ordered a gown for her from
Orense, that she might visit the Minister&#39;s lady.
And the gown came with its fresh bows and its stiff
linings and the girl, her face and hands washed, her
hair combed, her feet covered with new kid boots,
her eyes cast down and her hands crossed stiffly before
her, went to swell Nieves&#39; train. Victorina
took Clara Garc&iacute;a under her especial protection, arranged
her dress and hair and made her a present of
a bracelet, and they became inseparable companions.</p>

<p class="indent">They generally walked on the highroad, but as
soon as Clara grew more intimate with Victorina she
protested against this, declaring that the paths and
the by-ways were much more amusing and that
much prettier things were to be met with in them.
And she pressed Victorina&#39;s arm saying:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Segundo knows lovely walks!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">As chance would have it, that same afternoon, returning
to the town, they caught sight of a man
stealing along in the shadow of the houses, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page140" id="page140"></a>[pg&nbsp;140]</span>
Clara, who was on the other side of the way, ran over
to him, and threw her arm around his waist, crying:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hey, Segundo; you can&#39;t escape from us now,
we have caught you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The poet gave a brotherly push to Clara, and ceremoniously
saluting Nieves, who returned his salutation
with extreme cordiality, he said to her:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The idea of this girl&mdash;I am sure she has been
making herself troublesome to you. You must excuse
her.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">They sat down on one of the benches of the
Plaza, to enjoy the fresh air, and when, on the following
day the party walked out after the siesta, Segundo
joined them, studiously avoiding Nieves as if
some secret understanding, some mysterious complicity
existed between them. He mingled among
the girls and, laying aside his habitual reserve, he
laughed and jested with Victorina, for whom he
gathered, as they walked along the hedges, ripe
blackberries, acorns, early chestnut burrs, and innumerable
wild flowers, which the girl put into a
little Russian leather satchel.</p>

<p class="indent">Sometimes Segundo led them along precipitous
paths cut in the living rock, bordered by walls, supporting
grapevines through which the expiring rays
of the sun could scarcely penetrate. Again he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page141" id="page141"></a>[pg&nbsp;141]</span>
would take them through bare and arid woods until
they reached some old oak grove, some chestnut
tree, inside whose trunk, decayed and split with age,
Segundo would hide himself while the girls hand in
hand danced around it.</p>

<p class="indent">One day he took them to the stone bridge that
crossed the Avieiro, under whose arches the black
water, cold and motionless, seems to be dreaming a
sinister dream. And he told them how in this spot,
where, owing to the water being deeper there and
less exposed to the sun&#39;s rays, the largest trout gathered,
a corpse had been found floating last month
near the arch. He took them to hear the echo also,
and all the girls were wild with delight, talking all
together, without waiting for the wall to repeat their
cries and shouts of laughter. On another afternoon
he showed them a curious lake regarding which
innumerable fables were told in the country&mdash;that
it had no bottom, that it reached to the center of
the earth, that submerged cities could be seen under
its surface, that strange woods floated and unknown
flowers grew in its waters. The so-called lake was
in reality a large excavation, probably a Roman
mine that had been flooded with water, which, imprisoned
within the chain of hillocks of argillaceous
tophus heaped up around it by the miners&#39; shovels,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page142" id="page142"></a>[pg&nbsp;142]</span>
presented a sepulchral and fantastic aspect, the
weird effect of the scene being heightened by the
somber character of the marsh vegetation which
covered the surface of the immense pool. When it
began to grow dark the children declared that this
lugubrious scene made them horribly afraid; the
girls confessed to the same feeling, and started for
the highroad running at the top of their speed, leaving
Segundo and Nieves behind. This was the first
time they had found themselves alone together, for
the poet avoided such occasions. Nieves looked
around uneasily and then, meeting Segundo&#39;s eyes
fixed, ardent and questioning upon hers, lowered
her gaze. Then the gloom of the landscape and the
solemnity of the hour gave her a contraction of the
heart, and without knowing what she was doing she
began to run as the girls had done. She heard Segundo&#39;s
footsteps behind her, and when she at last
stopped, at a little distance from the highroad, she
saw him smile and could not help smiling herself at
her own folly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Heavens! What a silly fright!&quot; she cried, &quot;I have
made myself ridiculous. I am as bad as the children!
But that blessed pool is enough to make one
afraid. Tell me, how is it that they have not taken
views of it? It is very curious and picturesque.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page143" id="page143"></a>[pg&nbsp;143]</span>
They returned by the highroad; it was now quite
dark and Nieves, as if wishing to efface the impression
made by her childish terror, showed herself
gay and friendly with Segundo; two or three times
her eyes encountered his and, doubtless through
absent-mindedness, she did not turn them aside.
They spoke of the walk of the following day; it
must be along the banks of the river, which was more
cheerful than the pond; the scenery there was beautiful,
not gloomy like that of the pool.</p>

<p class="indent">In effect the road they followed on the next day
was beautiful, although it was obstructed by the
osier plantations and canebrakes and the intricate
growth of the birches and the young poplars, which
at times impeded their progress. Every now and
then Segundo had to give his hand to Nieves and
put aside the flexible young branches that struck
against her face. Notwithstanding all his care, he
was unable to save her from wetting her feet and
leaving some fragments of the lace of her hat among
the branches of a poplar. They stopped at a spot
where the river, dividing, formed a sort of islet covered
with cats-tails and gladioli. A rivulet running
down the mountain-side mingled its waters silently
and meekly with the waters of Avieiro. At the
river&#39;s edge grew plants with dentated leaves and a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page144" id="page144"></a>[pg&nbsp;144]</span>
variety of ferns and graceful aquatic plants. Segundo
knelt down on the wet ground and began to
gather some flowers.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Take them, Nieves,&quot; he said.</p>

<p class="indent">She approached and, kneeling on one knee, he
handed her a bunch of flowers of a pale turquoise
blue, with slender stems, flowers of which she had
hitherto seen only imitations, as adornments for
hats, and that she had fancied had only a mythical
existence; flowers of romance, that she had thought
grew only on the banks of the Rhine, which is the
home of everything romantic; flowers that have so
beautiful a name&mdash;<i>Forget-me-not</i>.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page145" id="page145"></a>[pg&nbsp;145]</span></p>
<h2>XII.</h2>

<p class="indent">Nieves was what is called an exemplary wife,
without a dark page in her history, without a thought
of disloyalty to her husband, a coquette only in her
dress and in the adornment of her person, and even
in these practicing no alluring arts, content to obey
slavishly the dictates of fashion.</p>

<p class="indent">Her ideal, if she had any, was to lead a comfortable,
elegant existence, enjoying the consideration
of the world. She had married when she was very
young, Don Victoriano settling on her some thousands
of dollars, and on the wedding-day her father
had called her into his magisterial office and, keeping
her standing before him as if she were a criminal,
had charged her to respect and obey the husband
she had chosen. She obeyed and respected him.</p>

<p class="indent">And her obedience and respect were a torture to
Don Victoriano, who sought in marriage a compensation
for the long years he had spent in his law
office; years of loneliness during which his arduous
labors and confinement to business had prevented
him from forming any tender tie or cultivating gentle
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page146" id="page146"></a>[pg&nbsp;146]</span>
affections, permitting him at the most some hasty
pleasure, some reckless and exciting adventure,
which did not satisfy his heart. He fancied that the
beautiful daughter of the President of the Court
would requite him for all the tender joys he had
missed and he found with vain and bitter disappointment
that Nieves saw in him only the grave husband
who is accepted with docility, without repugnance,
nothing more. Respecting against his will
the peace of this superficial being, he neither could
nor dared disturb it, and he fretted his soul with
unavailing longings, hastening to the crisis of maturity
and multiplying the white patches that streaked
his black hair.</p>

<p class="indent">When the child was born Don Victoriano hoped
to repay himself with interest in new and holy
caresses, to take solace in a pure oasis of affection.
But the requirements of his position, the hurry of
business, the complex obligations and the implacable
cares of his existence, interposed themselves between
him and a father&#39;s joys. He saw his daughter only
from a distance, barely succeeding, when the coffee
was brought in, in having her for awhile on his
knee. And then came the first warnings of his
disease.</p>

<p class="indent">From the time in which his malady declared itself
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page147" id="page147"></a>[pg&nbsp;147]</span>
with all its afflicting symptoms, Nieves had still less
of her husband&#39;s society than before; it seemed to
her as if she had returned to the rosy days of her
girlhood, when she flitted about like a butterfly and
played at lovers with her companions, who wrote
her fictitious love-letters of an innocent nature, which
they put under her pillow.</p>

<p class="indent">She never had had much amusement since that
time. A great deal of amusement was to be found
in the routine of a methodical Madrid life! Yes,
there was a period during which the Marquis de
Cameros, a rich young client of Don Victoriano&#39;s,
had come to the house with some frequency, and he
had even been asked to dine with them three or four
times, without ceremony. Nieves remembered that
the Marquis had cast many furtive glances at her,
and that they had always met him, by chance, at
whatever theater they went to. It did not go beyond
this.</p>

<p class="indent">Nieves was now in the bloom of her second youth&mdash;between
twenty-nine and thirty&mdash;terrible epoch in
a woman&#39;s life; and if it brought her no red passion
flowers, at least she wished to adorn herself with the
romantic forget-me-nots of the poet. It seemed to
Nieves that in the porcelain vase of her existence a
flower had been wanting, and the fragile blue spray
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page148" id="page148"></a>[pg&nbsp;148]</span>
came to complete the beauty of the drawing-room
toy. Bah! What harm was there in all this? It
was a childish adventure. Those flowers, preserved
between the leaves of a costly prayer-book, inspired
her only with thoughts as pallid and sapless as the
poor petals now pressed and dry.</p>

<p class="indent">She had fastened the blue spray in her bosom.
How well it looked among the folds of the &eacute;cru lace!</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Tell me, mamma,&quot; Victorina had said to her that
night before going to bed, &quot;did Segundo give you
those pretty flowers?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, I don&#39;t remember&mdash;yes, I think that Garc&iacute;a
picked them for me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Will you give them to me to keep in my little
satchel?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Go, child, go to bed quickly. Mademoiselle, see
that she says her prayers!&quot;</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page149" id="page149"></a>[pg&nbsp;149]</span></p>

<h2>XIII.</h2>

<p class="indent">The proximity of the feasts put an end to long
walks. The promenaders confined themselves to
walks on the highroad, returning soon to the town,
where the plaza was crowded with busy people.
The promenaders included the young ladies of the
Combist party, gayly attired, parish priests, ill-shaven,
of sickly aspect and dejected looking, gamblers
of doubtful appearance and strangers from the
Border&mdash;all types which Agonde criticised with mordacity,
to Nieves&#39; great amusement.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do you see those women there? They are the
Se&ntilde;oritas de Gondas, three old maids and a young
lady, whom they call their niece, but as they have
no brother&mdash;&mdash;Those other two are the Molendes,
from Cebre, very aristocratic people, God save the
mark! The fat one thinks herself superior to Lucifer,
and the other writes poetry, and what poetry!
I tell Segundo Garc&iacute;a that he ought to propose to
her; they would make an excellent pair. They are
staying at Lamajosa&#39;s; there they are in their element,
for Do&ntilde;a Mercedes Lamajosa, when any visitor
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page150" id="page150"></a>[pg&nbsp;150]</span>
comes, in order that it may be known that they
are noble, says to her daughters: &#39;Girls, let one of
you bring me my knitting; it must be in the press,
where the letters-patent of nobility are.&#39; Those two
handsome, well-dressed girls are the Caminos, daughters
of the judge.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">On the eve of the fair the musicians paraded the
streets morning and afternoon, deafening everybody
with the noise of their triumphal strains. The
plaza in front of the townhall was dotted with
booths, which made a gay confusion of brilliant
and discordant colors. Before the townhall were
erected some odd-looking objects which with equal
probability might be taken for instruments of torture,
children&#39;s toys, or scarecrows, but which were in reality
fireworks&mdash;trees and wheels which were to burn
that night, with magnificent pomp, favored by the
stillness of the atmosphere. From the window of
the building issued, like a Titanic arm, the pole on
which was to be hoisted the gigantic balloon, and
along the balustrade ran a series of colored glasses,
forming the letters V. A. D. L. C.&mdash;a delicate compliment
to the representative of the district.</p>

<p class="indent">It was already dark when Don Victoriano, accompanied
by his wife and daughter, set out for the
townhall to see the fireworks. It was with difficulty
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page151" id="page151"></a>[pg&nbsp;151]</span>
they made their way through the crowd which filled
the plaza, where a thousand discordant noises filled
the air&mdash;now the timbrel and castanets in some
dance, now the buzz of the <i>zanfona</i>, now some slow
and melancholy popular <i>copla</i>, now the shout of some
aggressive and quarrelsome drunkard. Agonde gave
his arm to Nieves, made way for her among the
crowd, and explained to her the programme of the
night&#39;s entertainment.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Never was there seen a balloon like this year&#39;s,&quot;
he said; &quot;it is the largest we have ever had here.
The Romerists are furious.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And how has my likeness turned out?&quot; asked
Don Victoriano with interest.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh! It is superb. Better than the likeness in
<i>La Illustracion</i>.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">At the door of the townhall the difficulties increased,
and it was necessary to trample down without
mercy the country-people&mdash;who had installed
themselves there, determined not to budge an inch
lest they should lose their places&mdash;before they were
able to pass in.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;See what asses they are,&quot; said Agonde. &quot;It
makes no difference whether you step over them
or not, they won&#39;t rise. They have no place to
sleep and they intend to pass the night here;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page152" id="page152"></a>[pg&nbsp;152]</span>
to-morrow they will waken up and return to their
villages.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">They made their way as best they could over this
motley heap in which men and women were crowded
together, intertwined, entangled in repulsive promiscuity.
Even on the steps of the stairs suspicious-looking
groups were lying, or some drunken peasant
snored, surfeited with <i>pulpo</i>, or some old woman sat
counting her coppers in her lap. They entered the
hall, which was illuminated only by the dim light
shed by the colored glasses. Some young ladies
already occupied the space in front of the windows,
but the Alcalde, hat in hand, with innumerable apologies,
made them draw their chairs closer together
to make room for Nieves, Victorina, and Carmen
Agonde, around whom an obsequious circle gathered;
chairs were brought for the ladies, and the Alcalde
took Don Victoriano to the Secretary&#39;s office, where
a tray, with some bottles of Tostado and some atrocious
cigars, awaited him. The young ladies and the
children placed themselves in front, leaning on the
railing of the balcony, running the risk of having
some rocket fall upon them. Nieves remained a
little behind, and drew her silver-woven Algerian
shawl closer around her, for in this empty, gloomy
hall the air was chill. At her side was an empty
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page153" id="page153"></a>[pg&nbsp;153]</span>
chair, which was suddenly occupied by a figure
whose outlines were dimly distinguishable in the
darkness.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why, Garc&iacute;a,&quot; she cried, &quot;it is a cure for sore
eyes. We haven&#39;t seen you for two days.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You don&#39;t see me now, either, Nieves,&quot; said the
poet, leaning toward her and speaking in a low voice.
&quot;It would be rather difficult to see one here.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That is true,&quot; answered Nieves, confused by this
simple remark. &quot;Why have they not brought
lights?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Because it would spoil the effect of the fireworks.
Don&#39;t you prefer this species of semi-obscurity?&quot; he
added, smiling, before he uttered it, at the choice
phrase.</p>

<p class="indent">Nieves was silent. Unconsciously she was fascinated
by the situation, in which there was a delicate
blending of danger and security which was not without
a tinge of romance; she felt a sense of security
in the proximity of the open window, the young
girls crowded around it, the plaza, where the multitude
swarmed like ants, and whence came noises like
the roaring of the sea, and songs and confused cries
full of tender melancholy; but at the same time the
solitude and the darkness of the hall and the species
of isolation in which she found herself with the Swan
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page154" id="page154"></a>[pg&nbsp;154]</span>
afforded one of those chance occasions which tempt
women of weak principles, who are neither so imprudent
as to throw themselves headlong into danger,
nor so cautious as to fly from its shadow.</p>

<p class="indent">Nieves remained silent, feeling Segundo&#39;s breath
fanning her cheek. Suddenly both started. The
first rocket was streaking the sky with a long trail
of light, and the noise of the explosion, deadened
though it was by distance, drew a cheer from the
crowd in the plaza. After this advanced guard
came, one after another, at regular intervals, with
measured, hollow, deafening sound, eight bombs, the
signal announced in the programme of the feasts for
the beginning of the display. The window shook
with the report and Nieves did not venture to raise
her eyes to the sky, fearing, doubtless, to see it coming
down with the reverberation of the bombs.
After this the noise of the flying fireworks, chasing
one another through the solitudes of space, seemed
to her soft and pleasant.</p>

<p class="indent">The first of these were ordinary rockets, without
any novelty whatever&mdash;a trail of light, a dull report,
and a shower of sparks. But soon came the surprises,
novelties, and marvels of art. There were
fireworks that exploded, separating into three or four
cascades of light that vanished with fantastic swiftness
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page155" id="page155"></a>[pg&nbsp;155]</span>
in the depths of space; from others fell with
mysterious slowness and noiselessness violet, green,
and red lights, as if the angels had overturned in the
skies a casket of amethysts, emeralds, and rubies.
The lights descended slowly, like tears, and before
they reached the ground suddenly went out. The
prettiest were the rockets which sent down a rain of
gold, a fantastic shower of sparks, a stream of drops
of light as quickly lighted as extinguished. The
delight of the crowd in the plaza, however, was
greatest at the fireworks of three explosions and a
snake. These were not without beauty; they exploded
like simple rockets, sending forth a fiery
lizard, a reptile which ran through the sky in serpentine
curves, and then plunged suddenly into darkness.</p>

<p class="indent">The scene was now wrapped in darkness, now
flooded with light, when the plaza would seem to
rise to a level with the window, with its swarm of
people, the patches of color of the booths and the
hundreds of human faces turned upward, beaming
with delight at this favorite spectacle of the Galicians,
a race which has preserved the Celtic love and admiration
for pyrotechnic displays, for brilliantly illuminated
nights in which they find a compensation for
the cloudy horizon of the day.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page156" id="page156"></a>[pg&nbsp;156]</span>
Nieves, too, was pleased by the sudden alternations
of light and darkness, a faithful image of the
ambiguous condition of her soul. When the firmament
was lighted up she watched with admiration
the bright luminaries that gave a Venetian coloring
to these pleasant moments. When everything was
again enveloped in darkness she ventured to look at
the poet, without seeing him, however, for her eyes,
dazzled by the fireworks, were unable to distinguish
the outlines of his face. The poet, on his side, kept
his eyes fixed persistently on Nieves, and he saw her
flooded with light, with that rare and beautiful
moonlight glow produced by fireworks, and which
adds a hundredfold to the softness and freshness of
the features. He felt a keen impulse to condense in
one ardent phrase all that the time had now come
for saying, and he bent toward her&mdash;and at last he
pronounced her name!</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Nieves!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Had you ever seen fireworks like these before?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No; it is a specialty of this province. I like
them greatly. If I were a poet like you I would say
pretty things about them. Come, invent something,
you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Like them happiness brightens our existence, for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page157" id="page157"></a>[pg&nbsp;157]</span>
a few brief moments, Nieves&mdash;but while it brightens,
while we feel it&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Segundo inwardly cursed the high-sounding
phrase that he found himself unable to finish. What
nonsense he was talking! Would it not be better
to bend down a little lower and touch with his
lips&mdash;&mdash;But what if she should scream? She would
not scream, he would venture to swear. Courage!</p>

<p class="indent">In the balcony a great commotion was heard.
Carmen Agonde called to Nieves:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Nieves, come, come! The first tree&mdash;a wheel of
fire&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Nieves rose hastily and went and leaned over the
balustrade, thinking that it would not do to attract
attention sitting all the evening chatting with
Segundo. The tree began to burn at one end, not
without difficulty, apparently, spitting forth an
occasional red spark; but suddenly the whole piece
took fire&mdash;a flaming wheel, an enormous wafer of red
and green light, which turned round and round, expanding
and shaking out its fiery locks and making
the air resound with a noise like the report of fire-arms.
It was silent for a few brief instants and
seemed on the point of going out, a cloud of rosy
smoke enveloped it, through which shone a point of
light, a golden sun, which soon began to turn with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page158" id="page158"></a>[pg&nbsp;158]</span>
dizzying rapidity, opening and spreading out into an
aureole of rays. These went out one by one, and
the sun, diminishing in size until it was no larger
than a coal, lazily gave a few languid turns, and,
sighing, expired.</p>

<p class="indent">As Nieves was returning to her seat she felt a pair
of arms thrown around her neck. They were those
of Victorina who, intoxicated with delight at the
spectacle of the fireworks, cried in her thin voice:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Mamma, mamma! How lovely! How beautiful!
And Carmen says they are going to set off
more trees and a wheel&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She stopped, seeing Segundo standing beside
Nieves&#39; chair. She hung her head, ashamed of her
childish enthusiasm, and, instead of returning to the
window, she remained beside her mother, lavishing
caresses upon her to disguise the shyness and timidity
which always took possession of her when
Segundo looked at her. Two other pieces were
burning at two of the corners of the plaza, a pin-wheel
and a vase, that sent forth showers of light,
first golden, then blue. The child, notwithstanding
her admiration for the fireworks, did not appear to
have any intention of going to the window to see
them, leaving Nieves and Segundo alone. The latter
remained seated for some ten minutes longer, but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page159" id="page159"></a>[pg&nbsp;159]</span>
seeing that the child did not leave her mother&#39;s side,
he rose quickly, seized by a sudden frenzy, and
walked up and down the dimly-lighted hall with
hasty steps, conscious that for the moment he was
not sufficiently master of himself to maintain outward
calmness.</p>

<p class="indent">By Heaven, he was well employed! Why had
he been fool enough to let slip so favorable an opportunity!
Nieves had encouraged him; he had not
dreamed it; no; glances, smiles, slight but significant
indications of liking and good-will; all these
there had been, and they all counseled him to end so
ambiguous and doubtful a situation. Ah! If this
woman only loved him! And she should love him,
and not in jest and as a pastime, but madly! Segundo
would not be satisfied with less. His ambitious
soul scorned easy and ephemeral triumphs&mdash;all
or nothing. If the Madridlenian thought of flirting
with him she would find herself mistaken; he
would seize her by her butterfly wings and, even at
the cost of breaking them, he would hold her fast;
if one wished to retain a butterfly in his possession
he must pierce it through the heart or press it to
death. Segundo had done this a thousand times
when he was a boy; he would do it now again; he
was resolved upon it; whenever a light or mocking
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page160" id="page160"></a>[pg&nbsp;160]</span>
laugh, a reserved attitude or a tranquil look, showed
Segundo that Se&ntilde;ora de Comba maintained her self-possession,
his heart swelled with rage that threatened
to suffocate him; and when he saw the child
beside her mother, who was keeping up an animated
conversation with the little girl, as if she were
keeping her there as a protection, he determined
that he would not let the night pass without knowing
what were her feelings toward him.</p>

<p class="indent">He returned to Nieves, but she had now risen and
the child was drawing her by the hands to the window;
this was the solemn and critical moment; the
monster balloon had just been attached to the pole
for the purpose of inflating it; and from the plaza
came a loud buzz, a buzz of eager expectation. A
phalanx of Combist artisans, among whom figured
Ramon, the confectioner, were clearing a space
around it sufficiently large to allow of the fuse burning
freely, so that the difficult operation might be
accomplished. The silhouettes of the workmen,
illuminated by the light of the fuse, could be seen
moving about, bending down, rising up, dancing a
sort of mad dance. The darkness was no longer
illuminated by the glare of the rockets, and the
human sea looked black as a lake of pitch.</p>

<p class="indent">Still folded in innumerable folds, its sides clinging
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page161" id="page161"></a>[pg&nbsp;161]</span>
together, the balloon swayed feebly, kissing the
ground with its lips of wire, between which the ill-smelling
fuse was beginning to burn brightly. The
manufacturers of the colossal balloon proceeded to
unfold it gently and affectionately, lighting below it
other fuses to aid the principal one and hasten the
rarification of air in its paper body. This began to
distend itself, the folds opening out with a gentle,
rustling sound, and the balloon, losing its former
limp and lank appearance, began to be inflated in
places. As yet the figures on its sides appeared of
unnatural length, like figures reflected from the polished,
convex surface of a coffee urn; but already
several borders and mottoes began to make their
appearance here and there, acquiring their natural
proportions and positions and showing clearly the
coarse red and blue daubs.</p>

<p class="indent">The difficulty was that the mouth of the balloon
was too large, allowing the rarefied air to escape
through it; and if the fuses were made to burn with
greater force there was danger of setting the paper
on fire and instantly reducing the superb machine to
ashes&mdash;a terrible calamity which must be prevented
at all costs. Therefore many arms were eagerly
stretched out to support it, and when the balloon
leaned to one side many hands made haste to sustain
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page162" id="page162"></a>[pg&nbsp;162]</span>
it&mdash;all this to the accompaniment of cries,
oaths, and maledictions.</p>

<p class="indent">In the plaza the surging crowd continued to increase,
and the eager expectancy became momentarily
greater. Carmen Agonde, with her mellow laugh,
recounted to Nieves the plots that went on behind
the scenes. Those who were trying to push their
way to the front in order to overturn the fuses
and prevent the ascent of the balloon belonged to
the Romerist party; a good watch the maker of the
fireworks had been obliged to keep to prevent them
from wetting his powder trees; but the greatest
hatred was to the balloon, on account of its bearing
Don Victoriano&#39;s likeness; they had vowed and determined
that so ridiculous and grotesque an object
should not ascend into the air while they had life to
prevent it; and that they themselves would construct
another balloon, better than that of the townhall,
and that this should be the only one to ascend.
For this reason they applauded and uttered shouts
of derision every time the gigantic balloon, unable
to rise from the earth, fell down feebly to the right
or to the left, while Don Victoriano&#39;s partisans directed
their efforts on the one hand to protect from
all injury the enormous bulk of the balloon, on the
other to inflate it with warm air to make it rise.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page163" id="page163"></a>[pg&nbsp;163]</span>
Nieves&#39; eyes were fixed attentively on the monster,
but her thoughts were far away. Segundo had
succeeded in pushing his way through the crowd in
front of the window and was now sitting beside her,
on her right. No one was observing them now, and
the poet, without preface, passed his arm around
Nieves&#39; waist, placing his hand boldly on the spot
where, anatomically speaking, the heart is situated.
Instead of the elastic and yielding curve of the form
and the quickened pulsation of the organ, Segundo
felt under his hand the hard surface of one of those
long corset-breastplates full of whalebones, and furnished
with steel springs, which fashion prescribes
at the present day&mdash;an apparatus to which Nieves&#39;
form owed much of its slender grace. Infernal corset!
Segundo could have wished that his fingers
were pincers to pierce through the fabric of her
gown, through the steel whalebones, through her
inner garments, through the flesh and through the
very ribs and fasten themselves in her heart, and
seize it red-hot and bleeding and crush, tear, annihilate
it! Why could he not feel the throbbings of
that heart? Leocadia&#39;s heart, or even Victorina&#39;s,
bounded like a bird&#39;s when he touched it. And
Segundo, enraged, pressed his hand with greater
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page164" id="page164"></a>[pg&nbsp;164]</span>
force, undeterred by the fear of hurting Nieves, desiring,
on the contrary, to strangle her.</p>

<p class="indent">Surprised at Segundo&#39;s audacity, Nieves remained
silent, not daring to make the slightest movement,
lest by doing so she should attract attention, and
protesting only by straightening her form and raising
her eyes to his with a look of anguish, soon lowering
them, however, unable to resist the expression
in the eyes of the poet. The latter continued to
search for the absent heart without succeeding in
feeling anything more than the throbbing of his own
arteries, of his pulse compressed against the unyielding
surface of the corset. But fatigue finally
conquered, his fingers relaxed their pressure, his arm
fell down powerless, and rested without strength or
illusion on the form, at once flexible and unyielding,
the form of whalebone and steel.</p>

<p class="indent">Meanwhile the balloon, in defiance of the Romerist
intriguers, continued to expand, as its enormous
body was filled with gas and light, illuminating the
plaza like a gigantic lantern. It swayed from side to
side majestically, and on its immense surface could
be read plainly all the inscriptions and laudatory
phrases invented by the enthusiastic Combists. The
effigy, or rather the colossal figure of Don Victoriano,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page165" id="page165"></a>[pg&nbsp;165]</span>
which filled one of its sides completely, followed
the curve of the balloon and stood out, so
ugly and disproportioned that it was a pleasure to
see it; it had two frying-pans for eyes, the pupils
being two eggs fried in them, no doubt; for mouth
a species of fish or lizard and for beard a tangled
forest or map of blots of sienna and lampblack.
Giant branches of green laurel crossed each other
above the head of the colossus, matching the golden
palms of his court dress, represented by daubs of
ocher. And the balloon swelled and swelled, its distended
sides grew ever tenser and tenser, and it
pulled impatiently at the cord that held it, eager to
break away and soar among the clouds. The Combists
yelled with delight. Suddenly a murmur was
heard, a low murmur of expectation.</p>

<p class="indent">The cord had been dexterously cut and the balloon,
majestic, magnificent, rose a few yards above
the ground, bearing with it the apotheosis of Don
Victoriano, the glory of his laurels, mottoes and emblems.
In the balcony and in the plaza below
resounded a salvo of applause and triumphal acclamations.
Oh, vanity of human joys! It was not
one Romerist stone only but three at least that at
this instant, directed with unerring aim, pierced the
sides of the paper monster, allowing the hot air, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page166" id="page166"></a>[pg&nbsp;166]</span>
vital current, to escape through the wounds. The
balloon contracted, shriveled up like a worm when
it is trodden upon, and finally, doubling over in the
middle, gave itself up a prey to the devouring flames
lighted by the fuse which in a second&#39;s space enveloped
it in a fiery mantle.</p>

<p class="indent">At the same moment that the balloon of the
official candidate expired thus miserably, the little
Romerist balloon, its swelling sides daubed with
coarse designs, rose promptly and swiftly from a
corner of the plaza, resolved not to pause in its
ascent until it had reached the clouds.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page167" id="page167"></a>[pg&nbsp;167]</span></p>

<h2>XIV.</h2>

<p class="indent">Nieves spent a restless night and when she awoke
in the morning the incidents of the preceding evening
presented themselves to her mind vaguely and
confusedly as if she had dreamed them; she could
not believe in the reality of Segundo&#39;s singular
hardihood, that taking possession of her, that audacious
outrage, that she had not known how to resent.
How compromising the position in which the
daring of the poet had placed her! And what if
anyone had noticed it? When she bade good-night
to the girls who had been sitting with her at the
window, they had smiled in a way that was&mdash;well,
odd; Carmen Agonde, the fat girl with the sleepy
eyes and placid temper, gave evidence at times of a
strain of malice. But, no; how could they have
observed anything? The shawl she had worn was
large and had covered her whole figure. And
Nieves took the shawl, put it on and looked at herself
in the mirror, using a handglass to obtain a complete
view of her person, in order to assure herself
that, enveloped in this garment, it was impossible for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page168" id="page168"></a>[pg&nbsp;168]</span>
an arm passed around her waist to be seen. She
was engaged in this occupation when the door
opened and someone entered. She started and
dropped the glass.</p>

<p class="indent">It was her husband, looking more sallow than ever,
and bearing the traces of suffering stamped on his
countenance. Nieves&#39; heart seemed to turn within
her. Could it be possible that Don Victoriano suspected
anything? Her apprehensions were soon relieved,
however, when she heard him speak, with
ill-disguised pique, of the insulting behavior of the
Romerists and the destruction of the balloon. The
Minister sought an outlet for his mortification by
complaining of the pain of the pin-prick.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But did you ever see the like, child? What do
you think of it?&quot; he said.</p>

<p class="indent">He then went on to complain of the noise of the
fair, which had lasted all night and had not allowed
him to close his eyes. Nieves agreed that it was
extremely annoying; she, too, had been unable to
sleep. The Minister opened the window and the
noise reached them louder and more distinct. It
resembled a grand chorale, or symphony, composed
of human voices, the neighing of horses and mules,
the grunting of pigs, the lowing of cows, calves, and
oxen, hucksters&#39; criers, noises of quarreling, songs,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page169" id="page169"></a>[pg&nbsp;169]</span>
blasphemies, and sounds of musical instruments.
The flood-tide of the fair had submerged Vilamorta.</p>

<p class="indent">From the window could be seen its waves, a surging
sea of men and animals crowded together in inextricable
confusion. Suddenly among the throng
of peasants a drove of six or eight calves would rush
with helpless terror; a led mule had cleared a space
around him, dealing kicks to right and left, screams
and groans of pain were heard on all sides, but those
behind continued pushing those in front and the
space was filled up again. The venders of felt hats
were a curious sight as they walked about with their
merchandise on their heads, towers of twenty or
thirty hats piled one above another, like Chinese
pagodas. Other venders carried for sale, on a portable
counter slung from their necks by ribbons, balls
of thread, tape, thimbles, and scissors; the venders
of distaffs and spindles carried their wares suspended
around their waists, from their breast, everywhere,
as unskillful swimmers carry bladders, and the venders
of frying-pans glittered in the sun like feudal
warriors.</p>

<p class="indent">The confused din, the ceaseless movement of the
multitude, and the mingling together of human
beings and animals, made the brain dizzy, and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page170" id="page170"></a>[pg&nbsp;170]</span>
ear was wearied by the plaintive lowing of the cows
under the drivers&#39; lash, the terrified cries of women,
the brutal hilarity of drunken men who issued from
the taverns with hats pushed far back on their heads,
seeking an outlet for their superabundant energy by
assaulting the men or pinching the girls. The latter,
screaming with terror, escaped from the drunkards
to fall, perhaps, on the horns of some ox or to
receive a blow from the snout of some mule that
bathed their foreheads and temples in its frothy
saliva. But most terrifying of all was it to see
infants carried high above their mothers&#39; heads,
braving, like frail skiffs, the dangers of this
stormy sea.</p>

<p class="indent">Nieves remained for half an hour or so looking
out of the window, and then, sight and hearing both
weary, she withdrew. In the afternoon she watched
the scene again for a while. The buying and selling
was less brisk, and the better classes of the
Border began to make their appearance at the fair.
Agonde, who, absorbed in the desperate gambling
that went on in the back shop, had kept himself invisible
during the day, now went upstairs and, while
he wiped the perspiration from his brow, pointed out
to Nieves the notabilities of the place, as they
passed by, naming to her in turn the archpriests,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page171" id="page171"></a>[pg&nbsp;171]</span>
the parish priests, the physicians, and the
gentry.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That very thin man, riding that horse that looks
as if it had been strained through a colander, with
silver trimmings in his saddle and silver spurs, is
Se&ntilde;orito de Limioso, a scion of the house of the
Cid&mdash;God save the mark! The Pazo of Limioso is
situated in the neighborhood of Cebre. As for
money, they have not an <i>ochavo</i>; they own a few
barley-fields, and a couple of grapevines past yielding,
that bring them in a trifle. But do you suppose
that Se&ntilde;orito de Limioso would go into an inn to
dine? No, Se&ntilde;ora; he carries his bread and cheese
in his pocket, and he will sleep&mdash;Heaven knows
where. As he is a Carlist they may let him stretch
himself on the floor of Do&ntilde;a Eufrasia&#39;s back shop,
with the saddle of his nag for a pillow, for on a day
like this there are no mattresses to spare. And
you may be sure that his servant&#39;s belt bulges
out in the way it does, because he carries the nag&#39;s
feed in it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You exaggerate, Agonde.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Exaggerate? No, indeed. You have no idea
what those gentlemen are. Here they are called
<i>Seven on a horse</i>, because they have one horse for all
seven which they ride in pairs, in turn, and when
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page172" id="page172"></a>[pg&nbsp;172]</span>
they are near the town they stop to ride in, one by
one, armed with whip and spur, and the nag comes
in seven different times, each time with a different
rider. Why, see those ladies coming there, the one
on a donkey, the other on a mule&mdash;the Se&ntilde;oritas de
Loiro. They are friends of the Molendes. Look
at the bundles they carry before them; they are the
dresses for to-night&#39;s ball.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But are you really in earnest?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;In earnest? Yes, indeed, Se&ntilde;ora. They have
them all here, every article&mdash;the bustle, or whatever
it may be called, that sticks out behind, the shoes,
the petticoats, and even the rouge. And those are
very refined, they come to the town to dress themselves;
most of the young ladies, a few years ago,
used to dress themselves in the pine wood near the
echo of Santa Margarita. As they had no house in
the town to stay at, and they were not going to lose
the ball, at half-past ten or eleven they were among
the pines, hooking their low-necked dresses, fastening
on their bows and their gewgaws, and as fine as
you please. All the gentry together, Nieves, if you
will believe me, could not make up a dollar among
them. They are people that, to avoid buying lard,
or making broth, breakfast on wine and water.
They hang up the loaf of wheaten bread among the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page173" id="page173"></a>[pg&nbsp;173]</span>
rafters so that it may be out of reach and may last
forever. I know them well&mdash;vanity, and nothing
more.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The apothecary spoke angrily, multiplying instances,
and exaggerating them in the telling, with
the rage of the plebeian who eagerly seizes an opportunity
to ridicule the poor aristocracy, relating anecdotes
of everyone of the ladies and gentlemen&mdash;stories
of poverty more or less skillfully disguised.
Don Victoriano laughed, remembering some of the
stories, now become proverbial in the country, while
Nieves, her anxiety set at rest by her husband&#39;s laughter,
began to think without terror, with a certain
secret complacency, rather, of the episodes of the
fireworks. She had feared to see Segundo among the
crowd, but, as the night advanced and the brilliant
colors of the booths faded into the surrounding darkness,
and lights began to appear, and the singing of
the drunkards grew hoarser, her mind became tranquil,
and the danger seemed very remote, almost to
have disappeared. In her inexperience she had
fancied at first that the poet&#39;s arm would leave its
trace, as it were, on her waist, and that the poet
would seize the first opportunity to present himself
before her, exacting and impassioned, betraying himself
and compromising her. But the day passed by,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page174" id="page174"></a>[pg&nbsp;174]</span>
serene and without incident, and Nieves experienced
the inevitable impatience of the woman who waits in
vain for the appearance of the man who occupies
her thoughts. At last she remembered the ball.
Segundo would certainly be there.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page175" id="page175"></a>[pg&nbsp;175]</span></p>

<h2>XV.</h2>

<p class="indent">And she adorned herself for the town ball with a
certain illusion, with the same care as if she were
dressing for a soir&eacute;e at the palace of Puenteancha.</p>

<p class="indent">Naturally the gown and the ornaments were very
different from what they would have been in the
latter case, but they were selected with no less care
and consideration&mdash;a gown of white China cr&ecirc;pe,
high-necked, and without a train, trimmed with
Valenciennes lace, that fell in clinging folds, whose
simplicity was completed by long dark Su&egrave;de gloves
wrinkled at the wrist, reaching to the elbow. A
black velvet ribbon, fastened by a diamond and
sapphire horseshoe, encircled her neck. Her beautiful
fair hair, arranged in the English fashion, curled
slightly over the forehead.</p>

<p class="indent">She was almost ashamed of having selected this
toilette when she crossed the muddy plaza, leaning
on Agonde&#39;s arm, and heard the poor music, and
found the entrance of the townhall crowded with
country-people sitting on the floor, whom it was
necessary to step over to reach the staircase. On
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page176" id="page176"></a>[pg&nbsp;176]</span>
the landings ran the lees of the fair&mdash;a dark wine-colored
rivulet. Agonde drew her aside.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Don&#39;t step there, Nieves; take care,&quot; he said.</p>

<p class="indent">She felt repelled by this unsightly entrance, calling
to mind the marble vestibule and staircase of the
palace of Puenteancha, carpeted down the center,
with plants arranged on either side. At the door of
the apartment which she was now entering was a
counter laden with cakes and confectionery, at which
the wife of Ramon, the confectioner, holding in her
arms the inevitable baby, presided, casting angry
glances at the young ladies who had come to amuse
themselves.</p>

<p class="indent">Nieves was given a seat in the most conspicuous
part of the room, in front of the door. The whitewashed
walls were not very clean, nor was the red
cloth which covered the benches very fresh, nor did
the badly snuffed candles in the tin chandelier produce
a brilliant illumination. Owing to the large
number of people present the heat was almost insupportable.
In the center of the apartment the men
stood grouped together&mdash;the youth of Vilamorta,
visitors to the springs, strangers, gamblers, and the
gentry from the neighboring country, mingling in
one black mass. Every time the band struck up
anew, deafening the ear with its sonorous strains, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page177" id="page177"></a>[pg&nbsp;177]</span>
indefatigable dancers would leave the group and
hurry off in search of their partners.</p>

<p class="indent">Nieves watched the scene with amazement. The
young ladies, with their large chignons and their
clusters of curls, their faces daubed with coarse rice-powder,
their bodices cut low around the throat,
their long trains of cheap materials, continually
trodden upon and torn by the heavy boots of the
gallants, their clumsy, tastelessly arranged flowers,
and their short-wristed gloves of thick kid, too small
for their hands, all seemed to her strange and laughable.
She remembered Agonde&#39;s descriptions, the
toilet made in the pine grove, and fanned herself
with her large black fan as if to drive off the pestilent
air in which the whirl of the dance enveloped
her. The dancers pursued their task earnestly, diligently,
as if they were contending for a prize to
be awarded to the one who should first get out of
breath, moving, not with their own motion only, but
impelled by the jostling, pushing, and crowding of
those around them. And Nieves, accustomed to the
elegant and measured dancing of the soir&eacute;es, wondered
at the courage and resolution displayed by the dancers
of Vilamorta. Some of the girls, whose flounces
had been torn by some gallant&#39;s boot-heel, turned up
their skirts, quickly tore off the whole trimming,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page178" id="page178"></a>[pg&nbsp;178]</span>
rolled it into a ball, which they threw into a corner,
and then returned, smiling and contented, to the
arms of their partners. In vain the men wiped the
perspiration from their faces; their collars and shirt-fronts
grew limp, their hair clung to their foreheads;
the silk bodices of the ladies began to show stains
of perspiration, and the marks of their partners&#39;
hands. And the gymnastics continued, and the
dust and the particles of perspiration vitiated the
atmosphere, and the floor of the room trembled.
There were handsome couples, blooming girls and
gallant young men, who danced with the healthy
gayety of youth, with sparkling eyes, overflowing
with animation; and there were ridiculous couples,
short men and tall women, stout women and beardless
boys, a baldheaded old man and a stout, middle-aged
woman. There were brothers who danced
with their sisters through shyness, because they
had not the courage to invite other young ladies to
dance, and the secretary of the town council, married
for many years to a rich Orensen who was old and very
jealous, danced all the evening with his wife, dancing
polkas and waltzes in the time of a <i>habanera</i> to keep
from dying by asphyxiation.</p>

<p class="indent">When Nieves entered the ballroom, the other
women looked at her, first with curiosity, then with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page179" id="page179"></a>[pg&nbsp;179]</span>
surprise. How strange to come so simply dressed!
Not to wear a train a yard and a half long, nor a
flower in her hair, nor bracelets nor satin shoes. Two
or three ladies from Orense, who had cherished the
expectation of making a sensation in the ball of
Vilamorta, began to whisper among themselves,
criticising the artistic negligence of her attire, the
modesty of the white, high-necked bodice, and the
grace of the small head, with its elegantly arranged
hair, vaporous as the engravings in <i>La Illustracion</i>.
The Orensens determined to copy the fashion-plate,
the Vilamortans and the women of the Border, on
the contrary, criticised the Minister&#39;s lady bitterly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She is dressed almost as if she would dress at
home.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She does it because she doesn&#39;t want to wear her
good clothes here. Of course for a ball here&mdash;&mdash;She
thinks probably that we know nothing. But she
might at least have dressed her hair a little better.
And how easy it is to see that she is bored; look,
why, she seems to be asleep.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And a little while ago she seemed as if she
couldn&#39;t sit still a moment&mdash;she kept tapping the
floor with her foot as if she were impatient to be
gone.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">And it was true; Nieves was bored. And if the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page180" id="page180"></a>[pg&nbsp;180]</span>
young ladies who censured her could only have
known the cause!</p>

<p class="indent">She could see Segundo nowhere, anxiously as she
looked for him, at first with furtive glances, then
openly and without disguise. At last Garc&iacute;a came
to salute her, and then she could restrain herself no
longer, and making an effort to speak in a natural
and easy tone, she asked:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And the boy? It is a wonder he is not here.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Who? Segundo? Segundo is&mdash;so eccentric. If
you could only guess what he is doing now. Reading
verses or composing them. We must leave him
to his whims.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">And the lawyer waved his hands with a gesture
that seemed to say that the eccentricities of genius
must be respected, while in his own mind he said:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He is most likely with that damned old woman.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The truth is that nothing in the world would have
induced the poet, under the circumstances, to come
to a ball like the present one, to be obliged to dance
with the young country girls of his acquaintance, to
perspire and to be pulled about like the other young
men. And his absence, the result of his &aelig;sthetic
feeling, produced a marvelous effect on Nieves, effacing
the last remnant of fear, stimulating her coquettish
instincts, and piquing her curiosity.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page181" id="page181"></a>[pg&nbsp;181]</span>
At the same time, in the radical circle that surrounded
Don Victoriano and his wife, the approaching
departure of the Minister and Nieves for Las
Vides to be present at the vintage was discussed&mdash;a
project that delighted the Minister as an unexpected
holiday delights a schoolboy. The persons whom
the hidalgo had invited or intended to invite for
the festive occasion were named, and when Agonde
uttered Segundo&#39;s name Nieves raised her eyes, and
a look of animation lighted up her face, while she
said to herself:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He is fully capable of not going.&quot;</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page182" id="page182"></a>[pg&nbsp;182]</span></p>

<h2>XVI.</h2>

<p class="indent">A great day for Las Vides is the day appointed
by the town council for the inauguration of the vintage.
The whole year is passed in looking forward
to and preparing for the beautiful harvest time.
The vine is still clothed in purple and gold, but it
has already begun to drop a part of its rich garniture
as a bride drops her veil, the wasps settle in
clusters on the grapes, announcing to man that they
are now ripe. The last days of September, serene
and peaceful, are at hand. To the vintage without
delay!</p>

<p class="indent">Neither Primo Genday nor Mendez takes a moment&#39;s
rest. The bands of vintagers who come from
distant parishes to hire themselves out must be attended
to, must have their tasks assigned them; the
work of gathering in the grapes must be organized
so that it may be advantageously and harmoniously
conducted. For the labors of the vintage resemble,
somewhat, a great battle in which an extraordinary
expenditure of energy is required from the soldier,
a waste of muscle and of blood, but in which he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page183" id="page183"></a>[pg&nbsp;183]</span>
must be supplied, in return, with everything necessary
to recruit his strength during his moments of
repose. In order that the vintagers might engage in
their arduous labors with cheerfulness and alacrity, it
was necessary to have at hand in the cellar the cask of
must from which the carters might drink at discretion
when they returned exhausted from the task
of carrying the heavy <i>coleiro</i>, or basket, filled with
grapes up the steep ascents; it was necessary that
they should have an abundant supply of the thick
wine flavored with mutton suet, the sardines and the
barley-bread, when the voracious appetite of the
bands demanded them; to which end the fire was
always kept burning on the hearth at Las Vides and
the enormous kettles in which the mess was cooked
were always kept filled.</p>

<p class="indent">When in addition to this the presence of numerous
and distinguished guests be considered, some
idea may be formed of the bustle of the manor-house
during these incomparable days. Its walls
sheltered, besides the Comba family, Saturnino and
Carmen Agonde, the young and amiable curate of
Naya, the portly arch-priest of Loiro, Tropiezo,
Clodio Genday, Se&ntilde;orita de Limioso and the two
Se&ntilde;oritas de Molende. Every class was here represented,
so that Las Vides was a sort of microcosm or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page184" id="page184"></a>[pg&nbsp;184]</span>
brief compendium of the world of the province&mdash;the
priests attracted by Primo Genday, the radicals by
the head of the house of Mendez. And all these
people of conditions so diverse, finding themselves
associated together, gave themselves up to the enjoyment
of the occasion in the greatest possible harmony
and concord.</p>

<p class="indent">To the merriment of the vintagers the merriment
of the guests responded like an echo. It was impossible
to resist the influence of the Bacchic joyousness,
the delirious gayety which seemed to float in
the atmosphere. Among all the delightful spectacles
which Nature has to offer, there is none more
delightful than that of her fruitfulness in the vintage
time, the baskets heaped full of clusters of ruddy or
dark red grapes, which robust men, almost naked,
like fauns, carry and empty into the vat or wine-press;
the laughter of the vintagers hidden among
the foliage, disputing, challenging each other from
vine to vine to sing, a gayety which is followed by a
reaction at nightfall&mdash;as is usually the case with all
violent expressions of feeling in which there is a
great expenditure of muscular strength; the merry
challenges ending in some prolonged Celtic wail,
some plaintive <i>a-la&aacute;-la&aacute;</i>. The pagan sensation of
well-being, the exhilaration produced by the pure air
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page185" id="page185"></a>[pg&nbsp;185]</span>
of the country, the mere joy of existence, communicated
themselves to the spectators of these delightful
scenes, and at night, while the chorus of fauns and
Bacchantes danced to the sound of the flute and the
timbrel, the gentry diverted themselves with childish
frolics in the great house.</p>

<p class="indent">The young ladies slept all together in a large, bare
apartment, the Rosary-room, the male guests being
lodged by Mendez in another spacious room called
the screen-room, because in it was a screen, as ugly
as it was antique; the arch-priest only being excluded
from this community of lodging, his obesity and his
habit of snoring making it impossible for any person
of even average sensibility to tolerate him as a
roommate; and the gay and mischievous party
being thus divided into two sections, there came to be
established between them a sort of merry warfare, so
that the occupants of the Rosary-room thought of
nothing but playing tricks on the occupants of the
screen-room, from which resulted innumerable witty
inventions and amusing skirmishes. Between the
two camps there was a neutral one&mdash;that of the
Comba family, whose slumbers were respected and
who were exempt in the matter of practical jokes,
although the feminine band often took Nieves as
their confidante and counselor.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page186" id="page186"></a>[pg&nbsp;186]</span>
&quot;Nieves, come here, Nieves; see, how foolish Carmen
Agonde is; she says she likes the arch-priest,
that barrel, better than Don Eugeni&ntilde;o, the parish
priest of Naya, because it makes her laugh, she says,
to see him perspiring and to look at the rolls of fat
in the back of his neck. And say, Nieves, what
trick shall we play to-night on Don Eugeni&ntilde;o? And
on Ramon Limioso, who has been daring us all
day?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">It was Teresa Molende, a masculine-looking black-eyed
brunette, a good specimen of the mountaineer,
who spoke thus.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;They must pay for the trick they played on
us yesterday,&quot; added her sister Elvira, the sentimental
poetess.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What was that?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You must know that they locked Carmen up.
They are the very mischief! They shut her up in
Mendez&#39;s room. What is there that they won&#39;t
think of! They tied her hands behind her back with
a silk handkerchief, tied another handkerchief over
her mouth, so that she couldn&#39;t scream, and left her
there like a mouse in a mouse-trap. And we, hunting
and hunting for Carmen, and no Carmen to be
seen. And there we were thinking all sorts of things
until Mendez went up to his room to go to bed and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page187" id="page187"></a>[pg&nbsp;187]</span>
found her there. Of course they had that silly
creature to deal with, for if it had been I&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;They would shut you up too,&quot; declared Carmen.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Me!&quot; exclaimed the Amazon, drawing up her
portly figure. &quot;They would be the ones to get shut
up!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But they entrapped me into it,&quot; affirmed Carmen,
looking as if she were just ready to cry. &quot;See,
Nieves, they said to me: &#39;Put your hands behind
you, Carmi&ntilde;a, and we&#39;ll put a five-dollar piece in
them,&#39; and I put them behind me, and they were so
treacherous as to tie them together.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Nieves joined in the laughter of the two sisters.
It could not be denied that this simplicity was very
amusing. Nieves seemed to be in a new world in
which routine, the worn-out conventionalities of Madrid
society, did not exist. True, such noisy and ingenuous
diversions might at times verge on impropriety
or coarseness, but sometimes they were really entertaining.
From the moment the guests rose from
table in the afternoon nothing was thought of but
frolic and fun. Teresa had proposed to herself not
to allow Tropiezo to eat a meal in peace, and with
the utmost dexterity she would catch flies on the
wing, which she would throw slyly into his soup, or
she would pour vinegar into his glass instead of wine,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page188" id="page188"></a>[pg&nbsp;188]</span>
or rub pitch on his napkin so that it might stick to
his mouth. For the arch-priest they had another
trick&mdash;they would draw him on to talk of ceremonies,
a subject on which he loved to expatiate, and
when his attention was engaged, take away his plate
slyly, which was like tearing a piece of his heart out
of his breast.</p>

<p class="indent">At night, in the parlor of the turbid mirrors, in
which were the piano and the rocking-chairs, a gay
company assembled; they sang fragments of <i>El Juramento</i>,
and <i>El Grumete</i>; they played at hide-and-seek,
and, without hiding, played <i>brisea</i> with <i>malilla</i>
counters; when they grew tired of cards, they had
recourse to forfeits, to mind-reading, and other
amusements. And the frolicsome rustic nature once
aroused, they passed on to romping games&mdash;fool in
the middle, hoodman-blind, and others which have
the zest imparted by physical exercise&mdash;shouts,
pushes and slaps.</p>

<p class="indent">Then they would retire to their rooms, still excited
by their sports, and this was the hour when
their merriment was at its height, when they played
the wildest pranks; when they fastened lighted
tapers to the bodies of crickets and sent them under
the bedroom doors; when they took the slats out of
Tropiezo&#39;s bedstead so that when he lay down he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page189" id="page189"></a>[pg&nbsp;189]</span>
might fall to the ground and bruise his ribs. In the
halls could be heard smothered bursts of laughter
and stealthy footsteps, white forms would be seen
scurrying away, and doors would be hastily locked
and barricaded with articles of furniture, while from
behind them a mellow voice could be heard crying:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;They are coming!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Fasten the door well, girls! Don&#39;t open, not if
the king himself were to knock!&quot;</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page190" id="page190"></a>[pg&nbsp;190]</span></p>

<h2>XVII.</h2>

<p class="indent">Segundo was the last of the guests to arrive at
Las Vides. As he cared but little for games and as
Nieves did not take any very active part in them
either, they would often have found themselves
thrown for society upon each other had it not been
for Victorina, who, from the moment Segundo appeared,
never left her mother&#39;s side, and Elvira
Molende who, from the very instant of his arrival,
clung to the poet like the ivy to the wall, directing
on him a battery of sighs and glances, and treating
him to sentimental confidences and rhapsodies sweet
enough to surfeit a confectioner&#39;s boy. From the
moment in which Segundo set foot in Las Vides,
Elvira lost all her animation, and assumed a languishing
and romantic air, which made her cheeks
appear hollower and the circles under her eyes
deeper than ever. Her form acquired the melancholy
droop of the willow and, giving up sports and
pranks, she devoted herself exclusively to the Swan.</p>

<p class="indent">As it was moonlight, and the evenings were enjoyable
out of doors, as soon as the sun had set, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page191" id="page191"></a>[pg&nbsp;191]</span>
the labors of the day were ended, and the vintagers
assembled for a dance, some of the guests would
assemble together also in the garden, generally at
the foot of a high wall bordered with leafy camellias,
or they would stop and sit down for a chat at some
inviting spot on their way home from a walk. Elvira
knew by heart a great many verses, both good and
bad, generally of a melancholy kind&mdash;sentimental
and elegiac; she was familiar with all the flowers of
poetry, all the tender verses which constituted the
poetic wealth of the locality, and uttered by her thin
lips, in the silvery tones of her gentle voice, with the
soft accents of her native land, the Galician verses,
like an Andalusian moral maxim in the sensual
mouth of a gypsy, had a peculiar and impressive
beauty&mdash;the sensibility of a race crystallized in a
poetic gem, in a tear of love. These plaintive verses
were interrupted at times by mocking bursts of laughter,
as the gay sounds of the castanets strike in on
the melancholy notes of the bagpipes. The poems
in dialect acquired a new beauty, their freshness and
sylvan aroma seemed to augment by being recited
by the soft tones of a woman&#39;s voice, on the edge of
a pine wood and under the shadow of a grapevine,
on a serene moonlight night; and the rhyme became
a vague and dreamy melop&oelig;ia, like that of certain
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page192" id="page192"></a>[pg&nbsp;192]</span>
German ballads; a labial music interspersed with
soft diphthongs, tender <i>&ntilde;</i>&#39;s, <i>x</i>&#39;s of a more melodious
sound than the hissing Castilian <i>ch</i>. Generally, after
the recitations came singing. Don Eugenio, who
was a Borderer, knew some Portuguese <i>fados</i>, and
Elvira was unrivaled in her rendering of the popular
and melancholy song of Curros, which seems made
for Druidical nights, for nights illuminated by the
solemn light of the moon.</p>

<p class="indent">Segundo&#39;s heart thrilled with gratified vanity
when Elvira recited shyly, in alternation with the
verses of the popular and admired poets of the
country, songs of the Swan, which had appeared in
periodicals of Vigo or Orense. Segundo had never
written in dialect, and yet Elvira had a book in
which she pasted all the productions of the unknown
Swan; Teresa, joining in the animated conversation
with the best intentions in the word, betrayed
her sister:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She writes verses too. Come, child, recite something
of your own. She has a copy-book full of
things invented, composed by herself.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The poetess, after the indispensable excuses and
denials, recited two or three little things, almost
without poetic form, weak, sincere in the midst of
their sentimental falseness&mdash;verses of the kind which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page193" id="page193"></a>[pg&nbsp;193]</span>
reveal no artistic faculty, but which are the sure indication
that the author or authoress feels an unsatisfied
desire, longs for fame or for love, as the inarticulate
cry of the infant expresses its hunger. Segundo
twisted his mustache, Nieves lowered her eyes
and played with the tassels of her fan, impatient and
somewhat bored and nervous. This occurred two or
three days after the arrival of Segundo who, in spite
of all his attempts, had not yet been able to succeed
in saying a word in private to Nieves.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How uncultured these young ladies are!&quot; said
Se&ntilde;ora de Comba to herself, while aloud she said,
&quot;How lovely, how tender! It sounds like some of
Grilo&#39;s verses.&quot;</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page194" id="page194"></a>[pg&nbsp;194]</span></p>

<h2>XVIII.</h2>

<p class="indent">It was something different from poetry that
formed the theme of conversation of the head of
the house of Las Vides, the Gendays, and the arch-priest,
installed on the balcony under the pretext of
enjoying the moonlight, but in reality to discuss the
important question of the vintage.</p>

<p class="indent">A fine crop! Yes, indeed, a fine crop! The grape
had not a trace of o&iuml;dium; it was clean, full, and so
ripe that it was as sticky to the touch as if it had
been dipped in honey. There was not a doubt but
that the new wine of this year was better than the
old wine of last year. Last year&#39;s vintage was an
absolute failure! Hail to-day, rain to-morrow! The
grape with so much rain had burst before it was time
to gather it, and had not an atom of pulp; the result
was a wine that scarcely left a stain on the shirt-sleeves
of the muleteers.</p>

<p class="indent">At the recollection of so great a calamity, Mendez
pressed his thin lips together, and the arch-priest
breathed hard. And the conversation continued,
sustained by Primo Genday, who, with much verbosity,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page195" id="page195"></a>[pg&nbsp;195]</span>
spitting and laughter, recounted details of
harvests of twenty years before, declaring:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;This year&#39;s crop is exactly like the crop of &#39;61.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Exactly,&quot; assented Mendez. &quot;As for the Rebeco,
it will not give a load less this year, and the
Grilloa&mdash;I don&#39;t know but that it will give us six or
seven more. It is a great vine, the Grilloa!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">After these cheerful prognostications of a rich harvest,
Mendez described with satisfaction to his attentive
audience some improvements which he had
introduced into the cultivation of the vine. He had
most of his casks secured with iron hoops; they were
more expensive than wooden ones, but they lasted
longer and they saved the troublesome labor of making
new hoops for each harvest; he was thinking
too, by way of experiment, of setting up a wine-press,
doing away with the repulsive spectacle of the
trampling of the grapes by human feet, and in order
that the pressed skins and the pulp of the grapes
might not go to waste, he would distill from them a
refined alcohol which Agonde would buy from him
at its weight in gold.</p>

<p class="indent">Lulled by the grave voices discussing important
agricultural questions on the balcony, Don Victoriano,
somewhat fatigued by his expedition to the
vineyards, sat smoking in the rocking-chair, buried
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page196" id="page196"></a>[pg&nbsp;196]</span>
in painful meditations. Since his return from the
springs he had been growing weaker day by day;
the temporary improvement had vanished; the
debility, the unnatural appetite, the thirst, and the
desiccation of the body had increased. He remembered
that Sanchez del Abrojo had told him that a
slight perspiration would be of the greatest benefit
to him, and when he observed, after he had been
drinking the waters for a few days, the re-establishment
of this function, his joy knew no bounds. But
what was his terror when he found that his shirt,
stiff and hard, adhered to his skin as if it had been
soaked in syrup. He touched a fold of the sleeve
with his lips and perceived a sweetish taste. It was
plain! He perspired sugar! The glucose secretion
was, then, uncontrollable, and by a tremendous irony
of fate all the bitterness of his existence had come
to end in this strange elaboration of sweet substances.</p>

<p class="indent">For some days past he had noticed another alarming
symptom. His sight was becoming affected.
As the aqueous humor of the eye dried up the crystalline
lens became clouded, producing the cataract
of diabetes. Don Victoriano had chills. He regretted
now having put himself into the homicidal
hands of Tropiezo and drunk the waters. There
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page197" id="page197"></a>[pg&nbsp;197]</span>
was not a doubt but that he was being wrongly
treated. From this day forth a strict regimen, a
diet of fruits, fecula, and milk. To live, to live, but
for a year, and to be able to hide his malady! If
the electors saw their candidate blind and dying,
they would desert to Romero. The humiliation of
losing the coming election seemed to him intolerable.</p>

<p class="indent">Bursts of silvery laughter, and youthful exclamations
proceeding from the garden, changed the current
of his thoughts. Why was it that Nieves did
not perceive the serious condition of her husband&#39;s
health? He wished to dissemble before the whole
world, but before his wife&mdash;&mdash;Ah, if his wife belonged
to him she ought to be beside him now, consoling
and soothing him by her caresses instead of
diverting herself and frolicking among the camellias,
like a child. If she was beautiful and fresh and
her husband sickly, so much the worse for her.
Let her put up with it, as was her duty. Bah!
What nonsense! Nieves did not love him, had
never loved him!</p>

<p class="indent">The noise and laughter below increased. Victorina
and Teresa, the verses being exhausted, had
proposed a game of hide-and-seek. Victorina was
crying at every moment, &quot;Teresa&#39;s it!&quot; &quot;Segundo&#39;s
it!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page198" id="page198"></a>[pg&nbsp;198]</span>
The garden was very well adapted for this exercise
because of its almost labyrinthine intricacy,
owing to the fact of its being laid out in sloping terraces
supported on walls and separated by rows of
umbrageous trees, communicating with each other
by uneven steps, as is the case with all the estates in
this hilly country. Thus it was that the play was
very noisy, as the seeker had great difficulty in finding
those who were hiding.</p>

<p class="indent">Nieves endeavored to hide herself securely, through
laziness so as not to have to run after the others.
Chance provided her with a superb hiding-place, a
large lemon tree situated at one end of a terrace,
near some steps which afforded an easy means of
escape. She hid herself here in the densest part of
the foliage, drawing her light gown closely around
her so that it might not betray her. She had been
only a few moments in her hiding-place when a
shadow passed before her and a voice murmured
softly:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Nieves!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh!&quot; she cried, startled. &quot;Who has found me
out here?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No one has found you; there is no one looking
for you but me,&quot; cried Segundo vehemently, penetrating
into Nieves&#39; hiding-place with such impetuosity
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page199" id="page199"></a>[pg&nbsp;199]</span>
that the late blossoms which whitened the branches
of the giant tree showered their petals over their
heads, and the branches swayed rhythmically.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;For Heaven&#39;s sake, Garc&iacute;a!&quot; she cried, &quot;for
Heaven&#39;s sake, don&#39;t be imprudent&mdash;go away, or
let me go. If the others should come and find us
here what would they say? For Heaven&#39;s sake,
go!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You wish me to go?&quot; said the poet. &quot;But,
Se&ntilde;ora, even if they should find me here, there
would be nothing strange in that; a little while ago
I was with Teresa Molende behind the camellias
there; either we are playing or we are not playing.
But if you desire it&mdash;to please you&mdash;&mdash;But before
I go I wish to ask you a question&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Somewhere else&mdash;in the parlor,&quot; stammered
Nieves, lending an anxious ear to the distant noises
and cries of the game.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;In the parlor! Surrounded by everybody! No,
that cannot be. No, now, do you hear me?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, I hear you,&quot; she returned in a voice rendered
almost inaudible by terror.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, then, I adore you, Nieves; I adore you, and
you love me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hist! Silence, silence! They are coming. I
think I hear steps.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page200" id="page200"></a>[pg&nbsp;200]</span>
&quot;No, it is the leaves. Tell me that you love me
and I will go.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;They are coming! For Heaven&#39;s sake! I shall
die of terror! Enough of jesting, Garc&iacute;a, I entreat
you&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You know perfectly well that I am not jesting.
Have you forgotten the night of the fireworks? If
you did not love me you would have released yourself
from my arm on that night, or you would have
cried out. You look at me sometimes&mdash;you return
my glances. You cannot deny it!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Segundo was close to Nieves, speaking with fiery
impetuosity, but without touching her, although the
fragrant, rustling branches of their shelter closed
around them, inviting them to closer proximity.
But Segundo remembered the cold hard whalebones,
and Nieves drew back, trembling. Yes,
trembling with fear. She might cry out, indeed, but
if Segundo persisted in remaining how annoying it
would be! What a mortification! What gossip it
would give rise to! After all the poet was right&mdash;the
night of the fireworks she had been culpably
weak and she was paying for it now. And what
would Segundo do if she gave him the <i>yes</i> he asked
for? He repeated his proud and vehement assertion:</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page201" id="page201"></a>[pg&nbsp;201]</span>
&quot;You love me, Nieves. You love me. Tell me
that you love me, only once, and I will go.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Not far off could be heard the contralto voice of
Teresa Molende calling to her companions:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Nieves&mdash;where is she? Victorina, Carmen, come
in, the dew is falling!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">And another shrill voice, that of Elvira, woke the
echoes:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Segundo! Segundo! We are going in!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">In fact that almost imperceptible mizzle, which refreshes
the sultry nights of Galicia, was falling; the
lustrous leaves of the lemon tree in which Nieves sat,
shrinking back from Segundo, were wet with the
night dew. The poet leaned toward her and his
hands touched her hands chilled with cold and terror.
He crushed them between both his own.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Tell me that you love me, or&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But, good Heavens, they are calling me! They
are noticing my absence. I am cold!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Tell me the truth then. Otherwise there is no
human power that can tear me from here&mdash;come
what will. Is it so hard to say a single word?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And what do you want me to say, tell me?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do you love me, yes or no?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And you will let me go&mdash;go to the house?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page202" id="page202"></a>[pg&nbsp;202]</span>
&quot;Anything you wish&mdash;but first tell me, do you
love me?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The <i>yes</i> was almost inaudible. It was an aspiration,
a prolonged <i>s</i>. Segundo crushed her wrists in
his grasp.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do you love me as I love you? Answer plainly.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">This time Nieves, making an effort, pronounced
an unequivocal <i>yes</i>. Segundo released her hands,
raised his own to his lips with a passionate gesture
of gratitude, and springing down the stairs, disappeared
among the trees.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page203" id="page203"></a>[pg&nbsp;203]</span></p>

<h2>XIX.</h2>

<p class="indent">Nieves drew a long breath. She felt dazed. She
shook her wrists, hurt by the pressure of Segundo&#39;s
fingers, and arranged her hair, wet with the night
dew, and disordered by the contact of the branches.
What had she said after all? Anything, no matter
what, to escape from so compromising a situation.
She was to blame for having withdrawn from
the others and hidden herself in so retired a spot.
And with that desire to give publicity to unimportant
actions which seizes people when they have
something to conceal she called out:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Teresa! Elvira! Carmen! Carmen!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Nieves! where are you, Nieves?&quot; came in answer
from various quarters.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Here, beside the big lemon tree. Wait for me,
I am coming!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">When they entered the house, Nieves, who had
to some extent recovered her composure, began to
reflect on what had passed and could not but wonder
at herself. To say <i>yes</i> to Segundo. She had
uttered the word partly under compulsion, but she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page204" id="page204"></a>[pg&nbsp;204]</span>
had uttered it. How daring the poet had been. It
seemed impossible that the son of the lawyer of Vilamorta
should be so determined. She was a lady of
distinction, highly respected, her husband had just
been Minister. And Garc&iacute;a&#39;s family, what were
they&mdash;nobodies; the father wore collars frayed at
the edges that were a sight to see; they kept no servant;
the sisters ran about barefooted half the time.
Even Segundo himself&mdash;he had an unmistakable
provincial air and a strong Galician accent. He
could not indeed be called ugly; there was something
remarkable in his face and in his manner. He spoke
with so much passion! As if he commanded instead
of entreating! What a masterful air he had! And
there was something flattering to one&#39;s vanity in having
a suitor of this kind, so ardent and so daring.
Who had ever fallen in love with Nieves before?
There were three or four who had made gallant
speeches to her&mdash;one who had watched her through
his opera-glass. Everyone in Madrid treated her
with that indifference and consideration which respectable
ladies inspire.</p>

<p class="indent">For the rest, this persistency of Segundo&#39;s was to
a certain extent compromising. Would people notice
it? Would her husband notice it? Bah! Her
husband thought only of his ailments, of the elections.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page205" id="page205"></a>[pg&nbsp;205]</span>
He scarcely ever spoke to her of anything
else. But what if he should notice it? How horrible,
good Heavens! And the girls who had been
playing hide and seek, might they not suspect something?
Elvira seemed more languishing and sighed
more frequently than usual. Elvira admired Segundo.
He&mdash;no, he did not pay the slightest attention
to her. And Segundo&#39;s verses sounded well,
they were beautiful; they were worthy of a place in
<i>La Ilustracion</i>. In short, as they would be obliged
to return to Madrid before the elections, there was
hardly any real danger. She would always preserve
a pleasant recollection of the summer. The thing
was to avoid&mdash;to avoid&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">Nieves did not venture to tell herself what it was
necessary to avoid, nor had she settled this point
when she entered the parlor, where the game of tresillo
was already going on. Se&ntilde;ora de Comba
seated herself at the piano and played several quick
airs&mdash;polkas and rigadoons, for the girls to dance.
When she stopped they cried out for another air.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Nieves, the <i>mu&ntilde;eira</i>!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The <i>riveirana</i>, please!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do you know the whole of it, Nieves?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The whole of it&mdash;why, did I not hear it in the
feasts?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page206" id="page206"></a>[pg&nbsp;206]</span>
&quot;Let us have it then, come.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Who will dance it?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Who knows how to dance it?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Several voices answered immediately:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Teresa Molende; ah! it is a pleasure to see her
dance it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And who will be her partner?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ramonci&ntilde;e Limioso here, he dances it to perfection.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Teresa laughed in the deep, sonorous tones of a
man, declaring solemnly that she had forgotten the
mu&ntilde;eira&mdash;that she never knew it well. From the
tresillo table came a protest&mdash;from the master of the
house, Mendez: Teresina danced it to perfection.
Let her not try to excuse herself; no excuse would
avail her; there was not in all the Border a girl who
danced the riveirana with more grace; it was true
indeed that the taste and the skill for these old customs
of the country were fast disappearing.</p>

<p class="indent">Teresa yielded, not without once more affirming
her incompetence. And after fastening up her skirt
with pins, so that it might not impede her movements
she stopped laughing and assumed a modest
and ingenuous air, veiling her large lustrous eyes
under her thick lashes, dropping her head on her
breast, letting her arms fall by her sides, swaying
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page207" id="page207"></a>[pg&nbsp;207]</span>
them slightly, rubbing the balls of the thumbs and
the forefingers together, and thus, moving with very
short steps, her feet close together, keeping time to
the music, she made the tour of the room, with perfect
decorum, her eyes fixed on the floor, stopping
finally at the head of the room. While this was
taking place, Se&ntilde;orito de Limioso took off his short
jacket, remaining in his shirt-sleeves, put on his hat,
and asked for an indispensable article.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Victorina, the castanets.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The child ran and brought two pairs of castanets.
The Se&ntilde;orito secured the cord between
his fingers and after a haughty flourish, began his
r&ocirc;le. Teresita&#39;s partner was as lean and shriveled
as Don Quixote himself, and, like the Manchego
hidalgo, it was undeniable that he had a
distinguished and stately air, scrupulously as he
imitated the awkward movements of a rustic. He
took his place before Teresa and danced a quick
measure, courteously but urgently wooing her to listen
to his suit. At times he touched the floor with
the sole of his foot, at others with his heel or toe
only, almost twisting his ankles out of joint with
the rapidity of his movements, while he played the
castanets energetically, the castanets in Teresa&#39;s
hands responding with a faint and timid tinkle.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page208" id="page208"></a>[pg&nbsp;208]</span>
Pushing his hat back on his head the gallant looked
boldly at his partner, approached his face to hers;
pursued her, urged his suit in a thousand different
ways, Teresa never altering her humble and submissive
attitude nor he his conquering air, his gymnastics,
and his resolute movements of attack.</p>

<p class="indent">It was primitive love, the wooing of the heroic
ages, represented in this expressive Cantabrian dance,
warlike and rude; the woman dominated by the
strength of the man and, better than enamored,
afraid; all which was more piquant in view of the
Amazon-like type of Teresa and the habitual shyness
and circumspection of the Se&ntilde;orito. There
was an instant, however, in which the gallant peeped
through the barbarous conqueror, and in the midst
of a most complicated and rapid measure he bent his
knee before the beauty, describing the figure known
as <i>punto del sacramento</i>. It was only for a moment
however; springing to his feet he gave his partner a
tender push and they stood back to back, touching
each other, caressing each other, and amorously rubbing
shoulder against shoulder and spine against
spine. In two minutes they suddenly drew apart
and with a few complicated movements of the
ankles and a few rapid turns, during which Teresa&#39;s
skirts whirled around her, the riveirana came to an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page209" id="page209"></a>[pg&nbsp;209]</span>
end and a storm of applause burst from the spectators.</p>

<p class="indent">While the Se&ntilde;orito wiped the perspiration from
his brow and Teresa unpinned her skirt, Nieves, who
had risen from the piano, looked around and noticed
Segundo&#39;s absence. Elvira made the same observation
but aloud. Agonde gave them the clew to the
mystery.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No doubt he is at this moment in the pine
grove or on the river-bank. There is scarcely a
night in which he does not make eccentric expeditions
of the kind; in Vilamorta he does the
same thing.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And how is the door to be closed if he does not
come? That boy is crazy,&quot; declared Primo Genday.
&quot;We are not all going to do without our sleep, we
who have to get up early to our work, for that
featherhead. Hey, do you understand me? I will
shut up the house and let him manage in the best
way he can. Ave Maria!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Mendez and Don Victoriano protested in the
name of courtesy and hospitality, and until midnight
the door of Las Vides remained open, awaiting Segundo&#39;s
return. As he had not come by that time,
however, Genday went himself to bar the door muttering
between his teeth:</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page210" id="page210"></a>[pg&nbsp;210]</span>
&quot;Ave Mar&mdash; Let him sleep out of doors if he has
a fancy for doing so.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Segundo, in fact, was at this time on his way to
the pine grove. He was in a state of intense excitement,
and he felt that it would be impossible for him
in his present mood to meet anyone or to take part
in any conversation. Nieves, so reserved, so beautiful,
had said yes to him. The dreams of an ideal
love which had tormented his spirit were not, then,
destined never to be realized, nor would fame be unattainable
when love was already within his ardent
and eager grasp. With these thoughts passing
through his mind he ascended the steep path and
walked enraptured through the pine grove. At
times he would lean against the dark trunk of some
pine, his brow bared to the breeze, drinking in the
cool night air, and listening, as in a dream, to the
mysterious voices of the trees and the murmur of the
river that ran below. Ah, what moments of happiness,
what supreme joys, were promised him by this
love, which flattered his pride, excited his imagination
and satisfied his egotism, the delicate egotism
of a poet, avid of love, of enjoyments which the
imagination idealizes and the muse may sing without
degradation! All that he had pictured in his verses
was to be realized in his life; and his song would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page211" id="page211"></a>[pg&nbsp;211]</span>
ring forth more clearly and inspiration would flow
more freely, and he would write, in blood, verses that
would cause his readers&#39; hearts to thrill with emotion.</p>

<p class="indent">In defiance of duty and reason Nieves loved him&mdash;she
had told him so. The poet smiled scornfully
when he thought of Don Victoriano, with the profound
contempt of the idealist for the practical man
inept in spiritual things. Then he looked around
him. The pine grove had a gloomy air at this hour.
And it was cold. Besides it must be late. They
would be wondering at his absence in Las Vides.
Had Nieves retired? With these thoughts passing
through his mind he descended the rugged path and
reached the door ten minutes after the careful hand
of Genday had secured the bolt. The <i>contretemps</i>
did not alarm Segundo; he would have to scale
some wall; and the romance of the incident almost
pleased him. How should he effect an entrance?</p>

<p class="indent">Undoubtedly the easiest way would be by the garden,
into which he could lower himself from the
brow of the hill&mdash;a question of a few scratches, but
he would be in his own room in ten minutes&#39; time,
without encountering the dogs that were keeping
watch in the yard, or any member of the household,
as that side of the house, the side where the dining-room
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page212" id="page212"></a>[pg&nbsp;212]</span>
was situated, was uninhabited. And upon
this course he decided. He turned back and
ascended the top of the hill, not without some difficulty.
From thence he could command a view of
the gallery and a good part of the garden. He
studied the nature of the declivity, so as to avoid
falling on the wall and perhaps breaking his leg.
The hill was bare and without vegetation and the
figure of the Swan stood out boldly against the
background of the sky.</p>

<p class="indent">When Segundo fixed his eyes on the gallery for
the purpose of deciding on the safest place for a
descent, he saw something that troubled his senses
with a sweet intoxication, something that gave him
one of those delightful surprises which make the
blood rush to the heart to send it coursing back
joyful and ardent through the veins. In the semi-obscurity
of the gallery, standing among the flower-pots,
his keen gaze descried, without the possibility
of a doubt as to the reality of the vision, a white
figure, the silhouette of a woman, whose attitude
seemed to indicate that she too had seen him, had
observed him, that she was waiting for him.</p>

<p class="indent">Fancy swiftly sketched out and filled in the details
of the scene&mdash;a colloquy, a divine colloquy of love
with Nieves, among the carnations and the vines,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page213" id="page213"></a>[pg&nbsp;213]</span>
alone, without any other witnesses than the moon,
already setting, and the flowers, envious of so much
happiness. And with a swift movement he rolled
down the steep declivity, landing on the hard wall.
The fruit trees hid the path from him, and two or
three times he lost his way; at last he found himself
at the foot of the staircase leading to the gallery,
and he raised his eyes to satisfy himself as to the
reality of the lovely apparition. A woman dressed in
white was indeed waiting there, leaning over the
wooden balustrade of the balcony; but the distance
did not now admit of any optical illusion; it was Elvira
Molende, in a percale wrapper, her hair hanging
loose about her shoulders, as if she were an actress
rehearsing the r&ocirc;le of <i>Sonnambula</i>. How eagerly
the poor girl was leaning over the balustrade! The
poet would swear that she even called his name
softly, with a tender lisp.</p>

<p class="indent">And he passed on. He made the tour of the garden,
entered the courtyard by the inner door, which
was not closed at night, and knocked loudly at the
door of the kitchen. The servant opened it for him,
cursing to himself the young gentlemen who stayed
up late at night because they were not obliged to
rise early in the morning to open the cellar for the
grape-tramplers.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page214" id="page214"></a>[pg&nbsp;214]</span></p>

<h2>XX.</h2>

<p class="indent">As the time occupied in the gathering of the
grapes and the elaboration of the wine in the spacious
cellar of Mendez was so prolonged, and as in
that part of the country everyone has his own crop,
however small, to gather in, part of the guests went
away, desirous of attending to their own vineyards.
Se&ntilde;orito de Limioso needed to see for himself how,
between o&iuml;dium, the blackbirds, the neighbors, and
the wasps, not a single bunch of grapes had been
left him; the Se&ntilde;oritas de Molende had to hang up
with their own hands the grapes of their famous
Tostado, renowned throughout the country; and for
similar reasons Saturnino Agonde, the arch-priest,
and the curate of Naya took their leave one by one,
the court of Las Vides being reduced to Carmen
Agonde, maid of honor, Clodio Genday, Aulic councilor,
Tropiezo, court physician, and Segundo, who
might well be the page or the troubadour charged
to divert the ch&acirc;telaine with his ditties.</p>

<p class="indent">Segundo was consumed with a feverish impatience
hitherto unknown to him. Since the day of the interview
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page215" id="page215"></a>[pg&nbsp;215]</span>
in the lemon tree Nieves had shunned every
occasion of being alone with him; and the feverish
dream that haunted his sleep, the intolerable anguish
which consumed him, was that he had advanced no
further than the fugitive <i>yes</i>, which he sometimes
even doubted he had heard. He could not endure
this slow torture, this ceaseless martyrdom; he
would have been less unhappy if instead of encouraging
him Nieves had requited his love with open
scorn. It was not the brutal desire for positive victories
which thus tormented him; all he wished was
to convince himself that he was really loved, and
that under that steely corset a tender heart throbbed.
And so mad was his passion that when he found it
impossible to approach Nieves, he was seized by an
almost irresistible impulse to cry out, &quot;Nieves, tell
me again that you love me!&quot; Always, always obstacles
between the two; the child was always at
her mother&#39;s side. Of what avail was it to be rid of
Elvira Molende who, since the memorable night on
which she had kept guard in the gallery, had looked
at the poet with an expression that was half satirical,
half mournful? The departure of the poetess removed
an obstacle, indeed, but it did not put an
end to his difficulties.</p>

<p class="indent">Segundo suffered in his vanity, wounded by the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page216" id="page216"></a>[pg&nbsp;216]</span>
systematic reserve of Nieves, as well as in his love,
his ardent longing for the impossible. It was already
October; the ex-Minister spoke of taking his departure
immediately, and although Segundo counted
on establishing himself in Madrid later on through
his influence, and meeting Nieves again, an infallible
instinct told him that between Nieves and himself
there existed no other bond of union than their
temporary sojourn in Las Vides, the poetic influences
of the season, the accident of living under the
same roof, and that if this dream did not take shape
before their separation it would be as ephemeral as
the vine leaves that were now falling around them,
withered and sapless.</p>

<p class="indent">Autumn was parting with its glories; the wrinkled
and knotted vine stalks, the dry and shrunken vine
branches, lay bare to view, and the wind moaned
sadly, stripping their leaves from the boughs of the
fruit trees. One day Victorina asked Segundo:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;When are we going to the pine grove to hear it
sing?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Whenever you like, child. This afternoon if
your mother wishes it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The child conveyed the proposition to Nieves.
For some time past Victorina had been more than
usually demonstrative toward her mother, leaning
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page217" id="page217"></a>[pg&nbsp;217]</span>
her head upon Nieves&#39; breast, hiding her cheek in
her neck, passing her hands over her hair and her
shoulders while she would repeat softly, in a voice
that seemed to ask for a caress:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Mamma! mamma!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">But the eyes of the miniature woman, half-veiled
by their long lashes, were fixed with loving, longing
glance, not on her mother, but on the poet, whose
words the child drank in eagerly, turning very red if
he chanced to make some jesting remark to her or
gave any other indication of being aware of her
presence.</p>

<p class="indent">Nieves objected a little at first, not wishing to
appear credulous or superstitious.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But what has put such an idea into your head?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Mamma, when Segundo says that the pines sing,
they sing, mamma, there is not a doubt of it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But you don&#39;t know,&quot; said Nieves, bestowing on
the poet a smile in which there was more sugar than
salt&mdash;&quot;that Segundo writes poetry, and that people
who write poetry are permitted to&mdash;to invent&mdash;a
little?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, Se&ntilde;ora,&quot; cried Segundo. &quot;Do not teach
your child what is not true. Do not deceive her.
In society it often happens that we utter with the
lips sentiments that are far from the heart, but in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page218" id="page218"></a>[pg&nbsp;218]</span>
poetry we lay bare the feelings of the inmost soul,
feelings which in the world we are obliged to hide in
our own breasts, through respect&mdash;or through prudence.
Believe me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Say, mamma, are we going there to-day?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Where?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;To the pine grove.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If you are very anxious to go. What an obstinate
child! But indeed I too am curious to hear
this orchestra.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Only Nieves, Victorina, Carmen, Segundo, and
Tropiezo took part in the expedition. The elders
remained behind smoking and looking on at the
important operation of covering and closing some of
the vats which contained the must, now fermented.
As Mendez saw the party about to start, he called
out in a tone of paternal warning:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Take care with the descent. The pine needles in
this hot weather are as slippery as if they had been
rubbed with soap. The ladies must be helped down.
You, Victorina, don&#39;t be crazy; don&#39;t go rushing
about there.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The famous pine grove was distant some quarter
of a league, but they spent fully three-quarters of an
hour in making the ascent, along a path as steep,
narrow, and rugged as the ascent to heaven is said to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page219" id="page219"></a>[pg&nbsp;219]</span>
be, and which long before reaching the wood was
carpeted with the polished, smooth, dry pine needles,
which, if they rendered the descent more easy than
was agreeable, compensated for it by making the
ascent extremely difficult, causing the foot to slip,
and fatiguing the ankles and the knees. Nieves
stopped from time to time to take breath, and was
at last fain to avail herself of the support of the
plump arm of Carmen Agonde.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;<i>Caramba</i>, this is like practicing gymnastics!
Whoever escapes being killed when we are going
back will be very lucky.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Lean well on me, lean well on me,&quot; said the
sturdy country girl. &quot;Many a limb has been broken
here already, no doubt. This ascent is terrible!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">They reached the summit at last. The prospect
was beautiful, with that species of beauty that borders
on sublimity. The pine wood seemed to hang
over an abyss. Between the trunks of the trees
could be caught glimpses of the mountains, of an
ashen blue blending into violet in the distance; on
the other side of the pine wood, that which overlooked
the river, the ground fell abruptly in a steep,
almost perpendicular descent, while far below flowed
the Avieiro, not winding peacefully along, but noisy
and foaming, roused into rage by the barrier opposed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page220" id="page220"></a>[pg&nbsp;220]</span>
to its progress by some sharp black rocks and separating
into numerous currents that curled around the
bowlders like angry green snakes covered with silver
scales. To the roaring and sobbing of the river the
pine wood kept accompaniment with its perpetual
plaint intoned by the summits of the trees, which
swayed and vibrated to the kisses of the breeze,
dolorous kisses that drew from them an incessant
moan.</p>

<p class="indent">The excursionists, impressed by the tragic aspect
of the scene, remained mute. Only the child broke
the silence, speaking in tones as hushed as if she
were in a church.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, it is true, mamma! The pines sing. Do
you hear them? It sounds like the chorus of bishops
in &#39;L&#39;Africaine.&#39; They even seem to speak&mdash;listen&mdash;in
bass voices&mdash;like that passage in the &#39;Huguenots&mdash;&mdash;&#39;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Nieves agreed that the murmur of the pines was
in truth musical and solemn. Segundo, leaning
against a tree, looked down at the river foaming below;
Victorina approached him, but he stopped her
and made her go back.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, my child,&quot; he said; &quot;don&#39;t come near; it is a
little dangerous; if you should lose your footing and
roll down that declivity&mdash;&mdash;Go back, go back.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page221" id="page221"></a>[pg&nbsp;221]</span>
As nothing further occurred to them to say about
the pines, the excursionists began to think of returning
home; Nieves was a little uneasy about the descent,
and she wished to undertake it before the sun
should set.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Now, indeed, we shall break some of our bones,
Don Fermin,&quot; she said to the doctor. &quot;Now, indeed,
you may begin to get your bandages and splints
ready.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There is another road,&quot; said Segundo, emerging
from his abstraction. &quot;And one which is much less
toilsome and much more level than this.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, talk to us now about the other road,&quot; cried
Tropiezo, true to his habit of voting with the opposition.
&quot;It is even worse than the one by which we
came.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How should it be worse, man? It is a little
longer, but as it is not so steep it is the best in the
end. It skirts the pine wood.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do you want to tell me which is the best road&mdash;me
who know the whole country as well as I know
my own house? You cannot go by that road; I
know what I am saying.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And I say that you can, and I will prove it to
you. For once in your life don&#39;t be stubborn. I
came by it not many days ago. Do you remember,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page222" id="page222"></a>[pg&nbsp;222]</span>
Nieves, the night we played hide-and-seek in the
garden, the night they barred me out and I got over
the wall?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Had it not been for the thick shade cast by the
pine trees and the fading daylight, it would have
been seen that Nieves blushed.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Let us take whichever road is easiest and most
level,&quot; she said, evading an answer. &quot;I am very awkward
about walking over rough roads.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Segundo offered his arm, saying jestingly:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That blessed Tropiezo knows as much about
roads as he does about the art of healing. Come,
and you shall see that we will be the gainers by it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Tropiezo, on his side, was saying to Carmen
Agonde, shaking his head obstinately:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, we will please ourselves and go by the cut,
and arrive before they do, safe and sound, with the
help of God.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Victorina, according to her custom, was going to
her mother&#39;s side, when the doctor called out to her:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Here, take hold of the end of my stick or you
will slip. Your mamma will have enough to do to
keep herself from falling. And God save us from
a <i>trip</i>,&quot; he added, laughing loudly at his jest.</p>

<p class="indent">The voices and footsteps receded in the distance,
and Segundo and Nieves continued on their way in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page223" id="page223"></a>[pg&nbsp;223]</span>
silence. The precipitous character of the path along
which they walked inspired Nieves with something
like fear. It was a little path cut on the slope of
the pine wood, on the very edge of the precipice,
almost overhanging the river. Although Segundo
gave Nieves the least dangerous side, that next the
wood, leaving himself scarcely a foothold, so that he
was obliged to place one foot horizontally before the
other, in walking, this did not set her fears at rest or
make the adventure seem any the less dangerous to
her. Her terror was increased a hundredfold when
she saw that they were alone.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Are they not coming?&quot; she asked anxiously.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We will overtake them in less than ten minutes.
They are going by the other road,&quot; answered Segundo,
without adding a single word of endearment,
or even pressing the arm which trembled with terror
within his.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Let us go on, then,&quot; said Nieves, in tones of
urgent entreaty. &quot;I am anxious to be home.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why?&quot; asked the poet, suddenly standing still.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am tired&mdash;out of breath&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, you shall rest and take a drink of water if
you desire it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">And with rash hardihood Segundo, without waiting
for an answer, drew Nieves down the slope and,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page224" id="page224"></a>[pg&nbsp;224]</span>
skirting the rock, stopped on a narrow ledge which
projected over the river. By the fading sunset light
they discried a crystal thread of water trickling down
the black front of the rock.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Drink, if you wish&mdash;in the palm of your hand,
for we have no glass,&quot; said Segundo.</p>

<p class="indent">Nieves mechanically released Segundo&#39;s arm,
scarcely conscious of what she was doing, and took
a step toward the stream; but the ground at the
base of the rock, kept moist by the dripping of the
water, was overgrown with humid vegetation as slippery
as sea-weed, and as she set her foot upon it she
slipped and lost her balance. In her vertigo, she
saw the river roaring menacingly below, the sharp
rocks waiting to receive her and mangle her flesh,
and she already felt the chill air of the abyss. A
hand clutched her by her gown, by her flesh, perhaps;
held her up and drew her back to safety. She
dropped her head on Segundo&#39;s shoulder and the
latter, for the first time, felt Nieves&#39; heart beat under
his hand. And how quickly it beat! It beat with
fear. The poet bent over her, and on her very lips
breathed this question:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do you love me? tell me, do you love me?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The answer was inaudible, for even if the words
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page225" id="page225"></a>[pg&nbsp;225]</span>
had been formed in her throat her sealed lips were
unable to articulate them. During this short space
of time, which was for them an eternity, there
flashed across Segundo&#39;s brain a thought potent and
destructive as the electric spark. The poet stood
fronting the precipice, Nieves with her back toward
it, kept from falling over its edge only by the arm
of her savior. A movement forward, a stronger
pressure of his lips to hers, would be sufficient to
make them both lose their balance and precipitate
them into the abyss. It would be a beautiful ending&mdash;worthy
of the ambitious soul of a poet. Thinking
of it Segundo found it alluring and desirable, and
yet the instinct of self-preservation, an animal impulse,
but one more powerful than the romantic idea,
placed between the thought and the action an insuperable
barrier. He pleased himself, in imagination,
with the picture of the two bodies clasped in
each other&#39;s arms, borne along by the current of the
river. He even saw in fancy the scene of the discovery
of the corpses, the exclamations; the profound
impression that such an event would cause in
the district; and <i>something</i>, some poetic feeling that
stirred and thrilled in his youthful soul, urged him
to take the leap; but at the same time a cold fear
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page226" id="page226"></a>[pg&nbsp;226]</span>
congealed his blood, obliging him to proceed slowly,
not toward the abyss, but in an opposite direction,
toward the path.</p>

<p class="indent">All this, short enough in the telling, was instantaneous
in the thinking. Segundo felt a cold chill
strike through him, putting to flight thoughts of
love as well as of death. It was the chill communicated
to him by the lips of Nieves, who had fainted
in his arms.</p>

<p class="indent">He dipped his handkerchief in the spring and
applied it to her temples and wrists. She half
opened her eyes. They could hear Tropiezo talking,
Carmen laughing; they were coming doubtless
in search of them, to triumph over them. Nieves,
when she came back to consciousness and found
herself still alone, did not make the slightest effort
to free herself from the poet&#39;s embrace.</p>


<hr class="hr2" />

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page227" id="page227"></a>[pg&nbsp;227]</span></p>

<h2>XXI.</h2>

<p class="indent">As if by tacit agreement the hero and heroine of
the adventure made light of the danger they had
run, to their companions in the excursion in the first
place, and afterward to the elders at Las Vides.
Segundo observed a certain reticence regarding the
particulars of the occurrence. Nieves, on the contrary,
was more talkative than usual, speaking with
nervous loquacity, going over the most insignificant
details a hundred times. She had slipped; Garc&iacute;a
had reached out his hand to her; she had caught it,
and as she was&mdash;well&mdash;timid, she had been a little
frightened, although there was not the slightest
occasion for being so. But the obstinate Tropiezo,
with mild scorn, contradicted her. Good Heavens,
how mistaken she was! No danger? Why, it was
only by a miracle that Nieves was not now floating
in the Avieiro. The ground there was as slippery
as soap, and the stones below were as sharp as razors,
and the current was so strong that&mdash;&mdash;Nieves
denied the danger, making an effort to laugh; but the
terror of the accident had left unmistakable traces
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page228" id="page228"></a>[pg&nbsp;228]</span>
upon her countenance, changing its warm healthy pallor
to a sickly hue, producing dark circles under her
eyes, and making her features twitch convulsively.</p>

<p class="indent">Segundo longed to say a few words to her, to ask
her to grant him an interview; he comprehended
that he must avail himself of these first moments,
while her soul was still under the softening influence
of gratitude and fright which made her cold heart
palpitate beneath the whalebone of her stays. In
the brief scene of the precipice the arrival of Tropiezo
had allowed Nieves no time to respond explicitly
to the poet&#39;s ardor, and Segundo wished to
come to some agreement with her, to devise some
means of seeing each other and talking to each other
alone, to establish the fact at once that all these
anxieties, these vigils, these intrigues, were love and
requited love&mdash;a mutual passion, in short. When
and how should he find the desired opportunity of
establishing an understanding with Nieves?</p>

<p class="indent">It may be said that in the history of every love
affair there exists a first period in which obstacles accumulate
and difficulties, seemingly insurmountable,
arise, driving to despair the lover who has made up
his mind to conquer them, and that there comes,
too, a second period in which the mysterious force
of desire and the power of the will sweep away
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page229" id="page229"></a>[pg&nbsp;229]</span>
these obstacles, and circumstances, for the moment
favorable, aid the lovers. So it happened on the
night of this memorable day. As Victorina had
been somewhat frightened, hearing of the danger
her mother had been in, she had been sent to bed
early, and Carmen Agonde had remained with her to
put her asleep by telling her stories. The principal
witnesses being thus removed and the elders plunged
in one of their interminable viticultural, agricultural,
and sociological discussions, Nieves, who had gone
out on the balcony for air&mdash;for she felt as if she had
a lump in her throat which prevented her from
breathing&mdash;had an opportunity to chat for ten minutes
with Segundo, who was standing near the window,
not far from the rocking-chairs.</p>

<p class="indent">Occasionally they would raise their voices and
speak on indifferent subjects&mdash;the afternoon&#39;s accident,
the strange singing of the pines. And low,
very low, the diplomatic negotiation of the poet followed
its course. An interview, a conversation with
some degree of freedom. Why, of course it could
be! Why could it not take place in the gallery that
very night? No one was going to think of going
there to spy out what was passing. He could let
himself down easily into the garden&mdash;&mdash;He could
not? She was very timid&mdash;&mdash;It would be wrong?
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page230" id="page230"></a>[pg&nbsp;230]</span>
Why?&mdash;She was tired and not very well&mdash;&mdash;Yes, he
understood. She would prefer the daytime, perhaps.
Well, the other would be better, but&mdash;&mdash;Without
fail? At the hour of the siesta? In the
parlor? No; nobody ever went there; everyone
was asleep. On her word of honor?&mdash;Thanks. Yes,
it was necessary to dissemble so as not to attract
attention.</p>

<p class="indent">Meantime the gentlemen at the tresillo table
talked of the vintage and its consequences. The
poor country girls earned a good deal of money at
the work. Apropos of which Don Victoriano gave
expression to some of his favorite ideas, referring to
English legislature, and eulogizing the wisdom of
that great nation whose laws regulating labor give
evidence of a careful study of the problems it involves,
and of some regard for the welfare of women
and children. With these serious disquisitions
the evening ended, every owl retiring to his olive
tree.</p>

<p class="indent">Nieves, seated at her toilet table, her open dressing-case
and a small silver-framed mirror before her,
was taking out, one by one, the tortoise-shell hair-pins
which fastened her hair. Mademoiselle gathered
them together and arranged them neatly in a
box and braided Nieves&#39; hair, after which the latter
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page231" id="page231"></a>[pg&nbsp;231]</span>
threw herself back in her seat and drew a deep
breath; suddenly she looked up.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If you could make me a cup of lime tea,&quot; she
said, &quot;in your own room, without troubling anybody?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The Frenchwoman left the room and Nieves
leaned her elbow thoughtfully on the table, resting
her cheek in the palm of her hand, without moving
her eyes from the mirror. Her face was deathly
pale. No, this life could not continue; if it did it
would carry her to her grave. She was very nervous&mdash;what
terrors! What anxiety, what moments of
anguish she had suffered! She had seen death face
to face, and had had more frights, more fears, more
misery in a single day than in all the previous years
of her existence put together. If this were love in
truth there was little that was pleasing in it; such
agitations were not suited to her. It was one thing
to like to be pretty, and to be told so, and even to
have a passionate adorer, and another to suffer these
incessant anxieties, these surprises that bring one&#39;s
heart to one&#39;s mouth and expose one to the risk of
disgrace and destroy one&#39;s health. And the poets
say that this is happiness. It may be so for them&mdash;as
for the poor women&mdash;&mdash;And why had she not the
courage to tell Segundo that there must be an end
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page232" id="page232"></a>[pg&nbsp;232]</span>
to this, to say to him: &quot;I can endure these alarms
no longer. I am afraid. I am miserable!&quot; Ah, she
was afraid of him, too. He was capable of killing
her; his handsome black eyes sent forth at times
electric sparks and phosphoric gleams. And then
he always took the lead, he dominated her, he mastered
her. Through him she had been on the point
of falling into the river, of being dashed to pieces on
the rocks. Holy Virgin! Why, only half an hour
ago did he not almost force her to agree to a meeting
in the gallery? Which would be a great piece of
madness, since it would be impossible for her to go
to that part of the house without her absence being
noticed by Mademoiselle, or someone else, and its
cause being discovered. Good Heavens! All this
was terrible, terrible! And to-morrow she must go
to the parlor at the hour of the siesta. Well, then,
she would take a bold resolution. She would go,
yes, but she would go to clear up this misunderstanding,
to give Segundo some plain talk that
would make him place some restraint upon himself;
that he should love her, very good; she had no
objection to that, that was well enough; but to
compromise her in this way, that was a thing unheard
of; she would entreat him to return to Vilamorta;
they would soon go to Madrid. Ah, how
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page233" id="page233"></a>[pg&nbsp;233]</span>
long that blessed Mademoiselle delayed with the
lime tea.</p>

<p class="indent">The door opened to admit, not Mademoiselle, but
Don Victoriano. There was nothing to surprise her
in his appearance; he slept in a sort of cabinet near
his wife&#39;s room and separated from it by a passageway,
and every night before retiring he gave a kiss to
the child, whose bed was beside her mother&#39;s; nevertheless
Nieves felt a chill creep over her, and she
instinctively turned her back to the light, coughing
to hide her agitation.</p>

<p class="indent">The truth was that Don Victoriano looked very
serious, even stern. He had not indeed been very
cheerful or communicative ever since his illness had
assumed a serious character; but in addition to his
air of dejection there was an indefinable something,
a darker gloom on his face than usual, a cloud pregnant
with storm. Nieves, observing that he did not
approach the child&#39;s bed, cast down her eyes and
affected to be occupied in smoothing her hair with
the ivory comb.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How do you feel, child? Have you recovered
from your fright?&quot; asked her husband.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No; I am still a little&mdash;&mdash;I have asked for
some lime tea.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You did well. See, Nieves&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page234" id="page234"></a>[pg&nbsp;234]</span>
&quot;Well&mdash;well?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;See, Nieves, we must go to Madrid at once.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Whenever you wish. You know that I&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, the thing is that it is necessary, indispensable.
I must put myself seriously under treatment,
child; for if things continue as they are now it will
soon be all over with me. I had the weakness to
put myself in the hands of that ass, Don Fermin.
God forgive me for it! and I fear,&quot; he added, smiling
bitterly, &quot;that I have made a fatal mistake. Let
us see if Sanchez del Abrojo will get me out of the
scrape&mdash;I doubt it greatly.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Heavens, how apprehensive you are!&quot; exclaimed
Nieves, breathing freely once more and availing herself
of the resource offered to her by Don Victoriano&#39;s
illness. &quot;Anyone would think you had an
incurable disease. When you are once in Madrid
and Sanchez has you under his care&mdash;in a couple of
months you will not even remember this trifling indisposition.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Bravo! child, bravo! I don&#39;t wish to hurt your
feelings or to seem unkind, but what you say proves
that you neither look at me, nor care a straw about
my health, nor pay any attention to me whatever,
which&mdash;forgive me&mdash;is not creditable to you. My
disease is a serious, a very serious one&mdash;it is a disease
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page235" id="page235"></a>[pg&nbsp;235]</span>
that carries people off in fine style. I am being
converted into sugar, my sight is failing, my head
aches, I have no blood left, and you, serene and gay,
sporting about like a child. A wife who loved her
husband would not act in this way. You have
troubled yourself neither about the state of my body
nor the state of my mind. You are enjoying yourself,
having a fine time, and as for the rest&mdash;a great
deal it matters to you!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Nieves rose to her feet, tremulous, almost weeping.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What are you saying? I&mdash;I&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Don&#39;t distress yourself, child; don&#39;t cry. You are
young and well; I am wasted and sickly. So much
the worse for me. But listen to me. Although I
seem to you dry and serious, I loved you tenderly,
Nieves, I love you still, as much as I love that child
who is sleeping there, I swear it to you before God!
And you might&mdash;you might love me a little&mdash;like a
daughter&mdash;and take some interest in me. The
trouble would not be for long now&mdash;I feel so sick.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Nieves drew near him with an affectionate movement
and he touched her forehead with his parched
lips, pressing her to him at the same time. Then he
added:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I have still another observation to make, another
sermon to preach to you, child.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page236" id="page236"></a>[pg&nbsp;236]</span>
&quot;What is it?&quot; murmured his wife smiling, but terrified.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That boy Garc&iacute;a&mdash;don&#39;t be alarmed, child, there
is no need for that&mdash;that boy looks at you sometimes
in a very curious way, as if he were making love to
you. No, I am not doubting you. You are and
you have always been an irreproachable wife&mdash;I am
not accusing you, nor do I attach any importance
to such folly. But, although you may not believe
it, the young men here are very daring; they are
shyer in appearance than those of the capital, but
they are bolder in reality. I spent my youthful
years here, and I know them. I am only putting
you on your guard so that you may keep that jackanapes
within bounds. For the rest of the time we
are to remain in this place, avoid those long walks
and all those other rusticities which they indulge in
here. A lady like you among these people is a sort
of queen, and it is not proper that they should take
the same liberties with you as with the Se&ntilde;oritas de
Molende or others like them&mdash;but I have already
told you that such a thought has not even crossed
my mind. It is one thing that this village Swan
should have fallen in love with you, and have given
you his hand to help you over the rocks, and another
that I should insult you, child!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page237" id="page237"></a>[pg&nbsp;237]</span>
Shortly afterward Mademoiselle entered with the
steaming cup of tea. And greatly Nieves needed
it. Her nerves were in a state of the utmost tension.
She was on the verge of a hysterical attack.
She even felt nausea when she took the first few
spoonfuls. Mademoiselle offered her some anti-hysterical
drops. Nieves drank the remedy, and
with a few yawns and two or three tears the attack
passed off. She thought she would go to bed, and
went into her bedroom. There she saw something
which renewed her uneasiness&mdash;Victorina, instead
of being asleep, lay with eyes wide open. She had
probably heard every word of the conversation.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page238" id="page238"></a>[pg&nbsp;238]</span></p>

<h2>XXII.</h2>

<p class="indent">She had in fact heard it all, from beginning to
end. And the words of the conjugal dialogue were
whirling around in her brain, mingling confusedly together,
stamping themselves in characters of fire on
her virgin memory. She repeated them to herself,
she tried to understand their meaning, she weighed
them, she drew conclusions from them.</p>

<p class="indent">No one can tell which is the precise moment that
divides day from night, sleeping from waking, youth
from maturity, and innocence from knowledge.
Who can fix the moment in which the child, passing
into adolescence, observes in herself that undefinable
something which may perhaps be called consciousness
of sex, in which vague presentiment is
changed into swift intuition, in which, without an
exact notion of the realities of life, she divines all
that experience will corroborate and accentuate later
on, in which she understands the importance of a
sign, the significance of an act, the character of a relationship,
the value of a glance, and the meaning of
a reticence. The moment in which her eyes, hitherto
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page239" id="page239"></a>[pg&nbsp;239]</span>
open only to external life, acquire power to
scrutinize the inner life also, and losing their superficial
brilliancy, the clear reflection of her ingenuous
purity, acquire the concentrated and undefinable expression
which constitutes the <i>glance of a grown
person</i>.</p>

<p class="indent">This moment arrived for Victorina at the age of
eleven, on the night we have mentioned, overhearing
a dialogue between her father and mother.
Motionless, with bated breath, her feet cold, her
head burning, the child heard everything, and afterward,
in the dim light of the bedroom, united broken
links, remembering certain incidents, and at last
understood without attaching much importance to
what she understood, reasoning, however, with singular
precocity, owing, perhaps, to the painful activity
with which imagination works in the silence of night
and the repose of the bed.</p>

<p class="indent">It is certain that the child slept badly, tossing
about restlessly in her monastic little bed. Two
ideas, especially, seemed to pierce her brain like
nails. Her father was ill, very ill, and he was annoyed
and displeased, besides, because Segundo had
fallen in love with her mamma. With her mamma.
Not with her! With her who preserved all the
flowers he had given her like relics.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page240" id="page240"></a>[pg&nbsp;240]</span>
The sorrows of childhood know neither limit nor
consolation. When we are older and more storms
have passed over us, and we have seen with astonishment
that man can survive griefs which we had
thought unsurvivable, and that the heavens do not
fall because we have lost what we love, it may almost
be said that absolute despair, which is the heritage
of childhood, does not exist. It was evident to Victorina
that her father was dying and that her mother
was wicked, and Segundo a villain, and that the
world had come to an end&mdash;and that she too, she
too, desired to die. If it were possible for the hair
to turn white at eleven, Victorina would have become
white on the night in which suffering changed
her from a bashful, timid, blushing child to a moral
being, capable of the greatest heroism.</p>

<p class="indent">Nor did Nieves enjoy the balmy sweets of slumber.
Her husband&#39;s words had made her thoughtful.
Was Don Victoriano&#39;s illness a fatal one? It
might be so! He looked greatly altered, poor fellow.
And Nieves felt a touch of grief and apprehension.
Why, who could doubt that she loved her
husband, or that she should regret his death? She
did not feel for him any passionate love, such as is
described in novels&mdash;but affection&mdash;yes. Heaven
grant the malady might be a trifling one. And if it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page241" id="page241"></a>[pg&nbsp;241]</span>
were not? And if she were to be left a wi&mdash;&mdash; She
did not dare to complete the word even in her
thoughts. To think of such a thing seemed like indulging
in wicked desires. No, but the fact was
that women, when their husbands die, were&mdash;Holy
Virgin! It must be a terrible grief. Well, but <i>if it
happened</i>? Segundo&mdash;Heavens, what folly! Most
assuredly such an absurdity had never entered his
head. The Garc&iacute;as&mdash;nobodies. And here a vivid
picture of all Segundo&#39;s relations and their manner
of living presented itself to her mind.</p>

<p class="indent">She would willingly have absented herself from
the rendezvous on the following day, because her
husband had begun to suspect something and the
situation was a compromising one, although in the
place designated for the interview the meeting between
them might always be attributed to chance.
On the other hand if she failed to meet him, Segundo,
who was so enamored, was fully capable of creating
a scandal, of going to look for her in her
room, of forcing an entrance into it through the
window.</p>

<p class="indent">After all, thinking well over the matter, she
judged it most prudent to comply with her promise
and to entreat Segundo to&mdash;forget her&mdash;or at least
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page242" id="page242"></a>[pg&nbsp;242]</span>
not to compromise her. That was the best course
to pursue.</p>

<p class="indent">Nieves passed the morning in a state of complete
prostration; she scarcely tasted a morsel at breakfast
and during the meal she kept her eyes turned
away from Segundo, fearing lest her husband should
surprise some furtive glance of intelligence between
them. To make matters worse, Segundo, desirous
of reminding her with his eyes of her promise, looked
at her on this day oftener than usual. Fortunately
Don Victoriano&#39;s attention seemed to be all given to
satisfying his voracious appetite for eating and drinking.
The meal being finished everyone retired as
usual to take the siesta. Nieves went to her room.
She found Victorina there, lying on the bed. For
greater precaution she asked her:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Are you going to sleep the siesta, my pet?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;To sleep, no. But I am comfortable here.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Nieves looked at herself in the glass and saw that
she was pale. She washed her teeth, and after satisfying
herself by a rapid glance that her husband was
resting in the other room, she stole softly into the
parlor. She was trembling. This atmosphere of
storm and danger, grateful to the sea-fowl, was fatal
to the domestic bird. It was no life to be always
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page243" id="page243"></a>[pg&nbsp;243]</span>
shuddering with fear, her blood curdled by fright.
It was not to live. It was not to breathe. She
would end by becoming crazy. Had she not fancied
just now that she heard steps behind her, as if someone
were following her? Two or three times she
had stopped and leaned, fainting, against the wall of
the corridor, vowing in her own mind that she would
never put herself in such a dilemma again.</p>

<p class="indent">When she reached the parlor she stopped, half
startled. It was so silent and drowsy in the semi-obscurity,
with the half-closed shutters through
which entered a single sunbeam full of dancing
golden motes, with its sleepy mirrors that were too
lazy to reflect anything from their turbid surfaces,
its drowsy asthmatic clock, whose face looked like a
human countenance watching her and coughing disapprovingly.
Suddenly she heard quick, youthful
foot-steps and Segundo, audacious, impassioned,
threw himself at her feet and clasped his arms around
her. She tried to restrain him, to advise him, to explain
to him. The poet refused to heed her, he continued
pouring forth exclamations of gratitude and
love and then, rising to his feet, he drew her toward
him with the irresistible force of a passion which
does not stop to consider consequences.</p>

<p class="indent">When Don Victoriano saw the child enter his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page244" id="page244"></a>[pg&nbsp;244]</span>
room, white as wax, livid, almost, darting fire from
her eyes, in one of those horror-inspired attitudes
which can neither be feigned nor imitated, he sprang
from the bed where he had been lying awake smoking
a cigar. The child said to him, in a choking
voice:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Come, papa! come, papa!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">What were the thoughts that passed through her
father&#39;s mind? It was never known why he followed
his daughter without putting to her a single question.
On the threshold of the parlor father and
child paused. Nieves uttered a shrill scream and
Segundo, with an impassioned and manly gesture,
placed himself before her to shield her with his
body. An unnecessary defense. In the figure of
the man standing on the threshold there was nothing
of menace; what there was in it to inspire terror
was precisely its air of stupor and helplessness; it
seemed a corpse, a specter overwhelmed with impotent
despair&mdash;the face, green rather than sallow, the
eyes opened, dull and fixed, the hands and feet trembling.
The man was making fruitless efforts to
speak; paralysis had begun with the tongue; he tried
in vain to move it in his mouth, to form sounds.
Horrible conflict! The words struggled for utterance
but remained unuttered; his face changed from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page245" id="page245"></a>[pg&nbsp;245]</span>
livid to red, the blood becoming congested in it, and
the child, clasping her father around the waist, seeing
this combat between the spirit and the body,
cried:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Help! help! Papa is dying!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Nieves, not daring to approach her husband, but
comprehending that something very serious was the
matter, screamed too for help. And at the various
doors appeared one after another Primo Genday and
Tropiezo in their shirt-sleeves, and Mendez with a
cotton handkerchief tied over his ears.</p>

<p class="indent">Segundo stood silent in the middle of the room,
uncertain what course to pursue. To leave the room
would be cowardly, to remain&mdash;&mdash;Tropiezo shook
him.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Go, flying, to Vilamorta, boy!&quot; he said. &quot;Tell
Doroteo, the cabman, to go to Orense and bring
back a doctor with him&mdash;the best he can find. I
don&#39;t want to make a trip this time,&quot; he added with
a wink. &quot;Run, hurry off!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The Swan approached Nieves, who had thrown
herself on the sofa and was weeping, her face covered
with her dainty handkerchief.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;They want me to go for a doctor, Nieves.
What shall I do?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Go!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page246" id="page246"></a>[pg&nbsp;246]</span>
&quot;Shall I return?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No&mdash;for God&#39;s sake leave me. Go bring the
doctor! go bring the doctor!&quot; And she sobbed
more violently than before.</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">In spite of all Segundo&#39;s haste, the physician did
not arrive in Las Vides until early on the morning
of the following day. He did not think the case an
unusual one. This disease often terminated in this
way, in paralysis; it was one of the most frequent
complications of the terrible malady. He added
that it would be well to remove the patient to
Orense, taking suitable precautions. The removal
was effected without much difficulty, and Don Victoriano
lived for a few days longer. Twenty-four
hours after the interment Nieves and Victorina,
attired in the deepest mourning, departed for the
capital.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page247" id="page247"></a>[pg&nbsp;247]</span></p>

<h2>XXIII.</h2>

<p class="indent">The black pall of winter has fallen over Vilamorta.
It is raining, and in the wet and muddy main street
and plaza no one is to be seen but occasionally some
countryman, riding enveloped in his grass cloth cloak,
his horse&#39;s hoofs clattering on the stone pavement,
raising showers of mud. There are now no fruit-venders
for the simple reason that there is no fruit;
all is deserted, damp, muddy, and gloomy; Cansin, in
listing slippers, a comforter around his neck, walks
up and down unceasingly before his door, to prevent
chilblains; the Alcalde avails himself of a very narrow
arch in front of his house to pass away the afternoon,
walking ten steps up and ten steps down,
stamping energetically to keep his feet warm&mdash;an
exercise which he affirms to be indispensable to his
digestion.</p>

<p class="indent">Now indeed the little town seems lifeless! There
are neither visitors to the springs nor strangers from
the surrounding country, neither fairs nor vintages.
Everywhere reigns the stillness and solitude of the
tomb, and a moisture so persistent that it covers
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page248" id="page248"></a>[pg&nbsp;248]</span>
with a minute green vegetation the stones of the
houses in course of construction. These little towns
in winter are enough to make the most cheerful person
low-spirited; they are the very acme of tedium,
the quintessence of dullness&mdash;the disinclination to arrange
one&#39;s hair, to change one&#39;s dress, the interminable
evenings, the persistent rain, the gloomy cold,
the ashen atmosphere, the leaden sky!</p>

<p class="indent">In the midst of this species of lethargy in which
Vilamorta is plunged there are, however, some happy
beings, beings who are now at the summit of felicity,
although soon destined to end their existence in the
most tragic manner; beings who, by their natural
instinct alone, have divined the philosophy of Epicurus
and practice it, and eat, drink, and make merry,
and neither fear death nor think of the unexplored
region which opens its gates to the dying, beings
who receive the rain on their smooth skins with
rejoicing, beings for whom the mud is a luxurious
bath in which they roll and wallow with delight,
abandoning the discomfort and narrowness of their
lairs and sties. They are the indisputable lords and
masters of Vilamorta at this season of the year;
they who with their pomps and exploits supply the
reunions at the apothecary&#39;s with food for conversation,
and entertainment for familiar gatherings in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page249" id="page249"></a>[pg&nbsp;249]</span>
which their respective sizes are discussed and they
are studied from the point of view of their personal
qualities, heated discussions taking place as to
whether the short or the long ear, the curly tail, the
hoof more or less curved upward, and the snout more
or less pointed, augur the more succulent flesh and
the more abundant fat. Comparisons are made.
Pellejo&#39;s hog is superb as far as size is concerned, but
its flesh, of an erysipelatous rosy hue, and its immense
flabby belly, betray the hog of relaxed muscle,
nourished on bakehouse refuse; a magnificent
swine, that of the Alcalde, which has been fed on
chestnuts, not so large as the other, but what hams
it will make! What hams! And what bacon!
And what a back, broad enough to ride upon! This
will be the swine of the season. There are not wanting
those who affirm, however, that the queen of the
swine of Vilamorta is the pig of Aunt G&aacute;spara,
Garc&iacute;a&#39;s pig. The haunches of this magnificent
animal look like a highroad; it once came near being
suffocated by its own fat; its teats touch its hoofs and
kiss the mud of the road. Who can calculate how
many pounds of lard it will yield, and the black puddings
it will fill with its blood, and the sausages that
its intestines will make?</p>

<p class="indent">It stops raining for a week; the cold grows more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page250" id="page250"></a>[pg&nbsp;250]</span>
intense, frost falls, whitening the grass of the paths
and hardening the ground. This is the signal for the
hecatomb, for which the auspices are now favorable,
for, in addition to the cold, the moon is in her last
quarter; if she were on the wane the flesh would
spoil. The hour has come for wielding the knife.
And through the long nights of Vilamorta resound
at the most unexpected moments desperate grunts&mdash;first
grunts of fury, that express the impotent rage
of the victim at finding himself bound to the bench,
and reveal in the degenerate domestic pig the descendant
of the wild mountain boar; then of pain,
when the knife penetrates the flesh, an almost human
cry when its blade pierces the heart, and at last a
series of despairing groans which grow fainter and
fainter as life and strength escape with the warm
stream of blood.</p>

<p class="indent">This bloodcurdling drama was being enacted in
the house of the lawyer Garc&iacute;a at eleven o&#39;clock on
a clear frosty December night. The girls, wild with
delight, and dying with curiosity, crowded around
the expiring pig, in whose heart and throat the
butcher, with rolled up sleeves and bare arms, was
about to plunge the knife. Segundo, shut up in his
bedroom, had before him some sheets of paper, more
or less covered with scrawls. He was writing verses.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page251" id="page251"></a>[pg&nbsp;251]</span>
But as the sounds of the tragedy reached him, he
dropped his pen with dismay. He had inherited
from his mother a profound horror of the spectacle
of the killing; it usually cost his mother ten or twelve
days of suffering, during which she was unable to
eat food, sickened by the sight of the blood, the
intestines and the viscera, so like human intestines
and human viscera, the greasy flitches of bacon
hanging from the roof, and the strong and stimulating
odor of the black pudding and spices. Segundo
abhorred even the name of pig, and in the morbid
condition of his mind, in the nervous excitement
which consumed him, it was an indescribable martyrdom
to be unable to set his foot outside the door
without stumbling against and entangling himself
among the accursed and repulsive animals, or seeing,
through the half-open doors, portions of their bodies
hanging on hooks. All Vilamorta smelled of pig-killing,
of warm entrails; Segundo did not know at
last where to hide himself, and intrenched himself in
his own room, closing the doors and windows tightly,
secluding himself from the external world in order
to live with his dreams and fancies in a realm where
there were no hogs, and where only pine groves, blue
flowers and precipices existed. Insufficient precaution
to free himself from the torture of that brutal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page252" id="page252"></a>[pg&nbsp;252]</span>
epoch of the year, since here in his own house he was
besieged by the drama of gluttony and realism.
The poet seized his hat and hurried out of the room.
He must flee where these grunts could not penetrate,
where those smells should not surround him.
He walked along the hall, closing his eyes in order
not to see, by the light of the candle which one of
the children was holding, Aunt G&aacute;spara with her
skeleton-like arm, bare to the elbow, stirring a red
and frothing liquid in a large earthern pan. When
they saw Segundo leaving the house the sisters burst
into shouts of laughter, and called to him, offering
him grotesque delicacies, ignoble spoils of the dying.</p>

<p class="indent">Leocadia had not retired; she felt ill and she was
dozing in a chair, wrapped in a shawl and shivering
with cold; she opened the door quickly to Segundo,
asking him in alarm if anything had happened. Nothing,
indeed. They were killing the pig at home&mdash;a
Toledan night; they would not let him sleep. Besides,
the night was so cold&mdash;he felt somewhat indisposed&mdash;as
if he had a chill. Would she make him a
cup of coffee, or better still, a rum punch?</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Both, my heart, this very instant!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Leocadia recovered her spirits and her energy as
if by enchantment. Soon there rose from the punch-bowl
the sapphire flame of the punch. In its glare
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page253" id="page253"></a>[pg&nbsp;253]</span>
the schoolmistress&#39;s face seemed very thin. It had
lost its former healthy color, a warm brown like that
of the crust of a well-baked loaf. The pangs of disappointed
love were revealed in the pallor of her
cheeks, in the feverish brightness of her eyes, the
purplish hue of her lips. Grief had given her prosaic
features an almost poetic stamp; as she had grown
thinner her eyes looked larger; she was not now the
robust woman, with firm flesh and fresh-colored lips,
who, pitted though she was by the smallpox, could
still draw a coarse compliment from the tavern-keeper;
the fire of an imperious, uncontrollable, and
exacting passion was consuming her inwardly&mdash;the
love which comes late in life, that devouring love
which reason cannot conquer, nor time uproot, nor
circumstances change, which fixes its talons in the
vitals and releases its prey only when it has destroyed
it.</p>

<p class="indent">And this love was of so singular a nature that,&mdash;insatiable,
volcanic, desperate, as it was,&mdash;far from
dictating acts of violence to Leocadia and drawing
from her furious reproaches, it inspired her with a
self-abnegation and a generosity without limits, banishing
from her mind every thought of self.</p>

<p class="indent">The summer, the vintage season, the whole period
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page254" id="page254"></a>[pg&nbsp;254]</span>
during which she had scarcely seen Segundo, when
she knew he had not given her a passing thought,
that he was devoting himself to another woman, had
been horrible for her; and yet not a jealous word,
not a complaint had crossed her lips, nor did she
once regret having given Segundo the money; and
when she saw the poet, her joy was so genuine, so
profound, that it effaced, as if by magic, the remembrance
of her sufferings and repaid her for them a
hundredfold.</p>

<p class="indent">Now there was an additional reason why she
should lavish her affection upon the poet. He too
was suffering, he was ill. What was the matter with
him? He himself did not know: hypochondria, the
grief of separation, spleen, the impatient disgust
produced by the contrast of his mean surroundings
with the dreams that filled his imagination. A constant
inappetency, depression of spirits, an uneasy
sensation in the stomach, nerves on the stretch, like
the strings of a guitar. And his love for Nieves was
not like Leocadia&#39;s love, one of those passions that absorb
the whole being, affect the heart, attenuate the
flesh, and subjugate the soul. Nieves lived only in
his imagination, in his vanity, in his lyrics, in his
romantic reveries, those eternal inspirers of love.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page255" id="page255"></a>[pg&nbsp;255]</span>
Nieves was the visible incarnation, in beautiful and
alluring form, of his longings for fame, his literary
ambition.</p>

<p class="indent">Leocadia had served the punch and was pouring
out the coffee when, her hand trembling with pleasure
and emotion, she spilled some of the hot liquid,
scalding herself slightly; she took no notice of the
burn, however, but went on, with the same solicitude
as always, to minister to Segundo&#39;s comfort. Thinking
to please and interest the poet she asked him for
news of the volume of poems which he had in hand,
and which was to spread his fame far beyond Vilamorta,
so soon as it should be published in Orense.
Segundo did not show much enthusiasm at this
prospect.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;In Orense,&quot; he said, &quot;in Orense&mdash;&mdash;Do you
know that I have changed my mind? Either I shall
publish it in Madrid or I shall not publish it at all.
The loss to Spanish literature would not be so very
great.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And why don&#39;t you want to publish it now in
Orense?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I will tell you. Roberto Blanquez is right in the
advice he gives me in a letter he has just written me
from Madrid. You know that Roberto is in a situation
there. He says that no one reads books published
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page256" id="page256"></a>[pg&nbsp;256]</span>
in the provinces; that he has noticed the contempt
with which books that do not bear the imprint
of some publishing house of the capital are
looked upon there. And besides, that they delay
a century here in printing a volume, and when it is
printed it is full of errors, and unattractive in appearance&mdash;in
short, that they do not take. And
therefore&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, then, let the book be published in Madrid.
How much would it cost?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Child, the prices Roberto tells me are enough to
frighten one. It seems that the affair would cost a
fortune. No publisher will buy verses or even
share with the author the expense of publishing
them.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Leocadia answered only by a smile. The little
parlor had a look of homelike comfort. Although
winter had despoiled the balcony of its charms, turning
the sweet basil yellow and withering the carnations,
within, the hissing of the coffee-pot, the alcoholic
vapor of the punch, the quietude, the solicitous
affection of the schoolmistress, all seemed to temper
and soften the atmosphere. Segundo felt a pleasant
drowsiness stealing over him.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Will you give me a blanket from your bed?&quot; he
said to the schoolmistress. &quot;There is not a spot at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page257" id="page257"></a>[pg&nbsp;257]</span>
home where I could rest to-night. I might sleep a
little on the sofa here.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You will be cold.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I shall be in heaven. Go.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Leocadia left the room, and returned dragging in
with her an unwieldy bulk&mdash;a mattress; then she
brought a blanket; then, pillows. Total, a complete
bed. For all that was wanting&mdash;only the
sheets&mdash;she brought them also.</p>


<hr class="hr2" />

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page258" id="page258"></a>[pg&nbsp;258]</span></p>

<h2>XXIV.</h2>

<p class="indent">Leocadia did not vacillate on the following day.
She knew the way and she went straight to the lawyer&#39;s
house. The latter received her with a frowning
brow. Did people think he was coining money?
Leocadia had now no land to sell; what she brought
was of trifling value. If she made up her mind to
mortgage the house he would speak to his brother-in-law
Clodio, who had some money saved, and who
would like to have some such piece of property.
Leocadia breathed a sigh of regret, it was not with
her as with the peasantry&mdash;she had no attachment
to land, but the house! So neat, so pretty,
so comfortable, arranged according to her own
taste!</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Pshaw, by paying the amount of the mortgage
you can have it back the moment you wish.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">So it was settled. Clodio handed out the money,
tempted by the hope of obtaining, at half its value,
so cozy a nest in which to end his bachelor existence.
In the evening Leocadia asked Segundo to
show her the manuscript of his poems and to read
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page259" id="page259"></a>[pg&nbsp;259]</span>
some of them to her. Frequent mention was made
in them, with reticences and transparent allusions, of
certain blue flowers, of the murmur of a pine wood,
of a precipice, and of various other things which
Leocadia knew well were not inventions, but had
their explanation in past, and to her unknown,
events. The schoolmistress divined a love story
whose heroine could be no one but Nieves Mendez.
But what she could not understand, what she could
not explain, was how Se&ntilde;ora de Comba, now a
widow, and free to reward Segundo&#39;s love, did not
do so immediately. The verses breathed profound
despondency, ardent passion, and intense bitterness.
Now Leocadia understood Segundo&#39;s sadness, his
dejection, his mental anguish. How much he must
suffer in secret! Poets, by their nature, must suffer
more and crueler tortures than the rest of humanity.
There was not a doubt of it&mdash;this separation, these
memories were killing Segundo slowly. Leocadia
hesitated how to begin the conversation.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;See, listen. Those verses are beautiful and deserve
to be printed in letters of gold. It just happens,
child, that I received some money a few days
ago from Orense. Do you know what I was thinking
of the other night while you were asleep in the
little bed I arranged for you? That it would be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page260" id="page260"></a>[pg&nbsp;260]</span>
better for you to go yourself to publish them&mdash;yonder&mdash;to
Madrid.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">To her great surprise she saw that Segundo&#39;s face
clouded. To go to Madrid now! Impossible; he
must first learn something of Nieves. The last
tragic scene of his love affair, the d&eacute;nouement of her
sudden widowhood, raised between them a barrier
difficult to pass. Nieves was rich, and if Segundo
should go to her now and throw himself at her feet,
he would not be the lover asking her to requite his
love, but the suitor to her hand, alleging anterior
rights and basing on them his aspirations to replace
her defunct husband. And Segundo, who had accepted
money from Leocadia, felt his pride rebel at
the thought that Nieves might take him for a fortune-hunter,
or might scorn him for his obscurity
and his poverty. But did not Nieves love him?
Had she not told him so? Why, then, did she not
send him some message. True, he had made no
attempt to communicate with the beautiful widow,
or to refresh her memory. He feared to do it awkwardly,
inopportunely, and so reopen the wound
caused by the death of her husband.</p>

<p class="indent">The volume of verses&mdash;an excellent idea! The
volume of verses was the one means of recovering
his place in Nieves&#39; recollection worthily, borne on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page261" id="page261"></a>[pg&nbsp;261]</span>
the wings of popular applause. If this volume were
read, admired, praised, it would win fame for its
author; the difference between his own and Nieves&#39;
social position, which might now make his pretensions
appear ridiculous, would disappear. &quot;To
marry!&quot; said Segundo to himself. Marriage seemed
to him a secondary matter. Let Nieves only love
him. It was love he asked, not marriage. Sitting
at Leocadia&#39;s very table he wrote to Blanquez, giving
him instructions, and prepared the manuscript to
post it, and made out the index and the title-page
with the impatient joy of one who, expecting to win a
fortune, buys a ticket in the lottery. When he was
gone Leocadia remained sunk in thought. Segundo
had no desire to go to Madrid. Then the gleam of
happiness that flashed across her mind at the thought
that Segundo should establish himself in Vilamorta
was quenched by two considerations&mdash;one was that
Segundo would die of tedium here; the other that
she could not long continue to supply his wants. In
mortgaging the house she had burned her last cartridge.
What should she mortgage now&mdash;herself?
And she smiled sadly. In the hall resounded the
steps of the neglected little cripple, on his way to
bed, where Flores would soon lull him to sleep with
her solecisms and barbarous litanies. The mother
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page262" id="page262"></a>[pg&nbsp;262]</span>
sighed. And this being, this being who had no support
but her&mdash;what should he live on? When ruin
had overtaken her, and she could no longer give him
food or shelter, what a mute and continual reproach
would the presence of the unhappy child be to her!
And how could she set him to work?</p>

<p class="indent">To work! This word brought to her mind the
plans she had matured in those hours of sleeplessness
and despair in which all the past is retraced in
thought and new plans are formed for the future
and every possible course of action is deliberated
upon. It was plain that Minguitos was unfitted for
the material labor of cultivating the ground, or for
making shoes, or grinding chocolate, like that good-looking
Ramon; but he knew how to read and write
and in arithmetic, with a little help from Leocadia,
he would be a prodigy. To sit behind a counter
kills nobody; to attend to a customer, to answer his
questions, take the money, enter down what is sold,
are rather entertaining occupations that cheer the
mind than fatiguing labors. In this way the little
hunchback would be amused and would lose a little
of his terror of strangers, his morbid fear of being
laughed at.</p>

<p class="indent">A few years before if anyone had proposed to Leocadia
to separate her from her child, to deprive him
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page263" id="page263"></a>[pg&nbsp;263]</span>
of the shelter of her loving arms, she would have
insulted him. Now it seemed to her so easy and
natural a solution of the question to make him a
clerk in a shop. Something, nevertheless, still
thrilled in the depths of her mother&#39;s heart, some
fibers still closely attached to the soul, that bled,
that hurt. She must tear them away quickly. It
was all for the good of the child, to make a man of
him, so that to-day or to-morrow&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">Leocadia held two or three consultations with
Cansin, who had a cousin in Orense, the proprietor
of a cloth shop; and Cansin, dilating upon his
influence with him, and the importance of the favor,
gave the schoolmistress a warm letter of recommendation
to him. Leocadia went to the city, saw
the shopkeeper, and the conditions on which he
agreed to receive Minguitos were agreed upon. The
boy would be fed and lodged, his clothes washed,
and he would receive an occasional suit, made from
the remnants of cloth left over in the shop. As to
pay, he would be paid nothing until he should have
acquired a thorough knowledge of the business&mdash;for
a couple of years or so. And was he very much
deformed? Because that would not be very pleasant
for the customers. And was he honest? He
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page264" id="page264"></a>[pg&nbsp;264]</span>
had never taken any money out of his mother&#39;s
drawer, had he?</p>

<p class="indent">Leocadia returned home with her soul steeped in
gall. How should she tell Minguitos and Flores?
Especially Flores! Impossible, impossible&mdash;she
would create a scandal that would alarm the neighborhood.
And she had promised to take Minguitos
without fail on the following Monday! A stratagem
occurred to her. She said that a relative of hers
lived in Orense and that she wished to take the child
there to make his acquaintance. She depicted the
journey in glowing colors, so that Minguitos might
think he was going on a pleasure trip. Did he not
want to see Orense again? It was a magnificent
town. She would show him the hot springs, the
Cathedral. The child, with an instinctive horror of
public places, of coming in contact with strangers,
sorrowfully shook his head; and as for the old servant,
as if she divined what was going on, she raged
and stormed all the week. When Sunday came and
mother and son were about to take their departure
in the stage-coach Flores threw her arms around the
neck of the boy as he was mounting the step, and
embraced him with the tremulous and doting fondness
of a grandmother, covering his face with kisses,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page265" id="page265"></a>[pg&nbsp;265]</span>
and moistening it with the saliva on her withered
lips. She spent the rest of the day sitting in the
doorway, muttering words of rage, or of tender pity,
her forehead pressed between her hands in an attitude
of despair.</p>

<p class="indent">Leocadia, once they were in the diligence, tried to
convince the boy that the change was for his good;
describing to him the pleasant life that awaited him
in that fine shop situated in the most central part of
Orense, which was so lively, where he would have
very little to do, and where he had the hope of earning,
if not to-day, to-morrow, a little money for himself.
At her first words the boy fixed on his mother
his astonished eyes, in which a look of intelligence
gradually began to dawn. Minguitos was quick
of comprehension. He drew up close to his
mother, and laid his head down on her lap without
speaking.</p>

<p class="indent">As he continued silent, Leocadia said to him:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What is the matter with you? Does your head
ache?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No; let me sleep so&mdash;for a little&mdash;until we reach
Orense.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">And thus he remained, quiet and silent, lulled to
sleep, apparently, by the creaking of the diligence
and the deafening noise of the windows rattling in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page266" id="page266"></a>[pg&nbsp;266]</span>
their sashes. When they reached the city Leocadia
touched him on the shoulder, saying:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We have arrived.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">They alighted from the stagecoach and then only
did Leocadia observe that her lap was moist and
that, on the spot where the boy had rested his forehead,
sparkled two or three crystal drops. But on
finding himself among strangers, in the gloomy
shop crowded with rolls of dark cloth, the hunchback&#39;s
attitude ceased to be resigned; he caught
hold of his mother&#39;s skirt with a despairing impulse,
uttering a single cry in which were concentrated all
his reproaches, all his affection:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;M-a-a-a-m-m-a&mdash;m-a-a-a-m-m-a!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">This cry still resounded through Leocadia&#39;s heart
when, on her arrival at Vilamorta, she saw Flores
lying in wait for her in the doorway. Lying in wait
is the exact expression, for Flores threw herself upon
her, the moment she appeared, like a bulldog, like a
wild animal asking for and demanding her young.
And as a man in a fit of rage throws at his adversary
whatever he finds nearest his hand so Flores
heaped on Leocadia every species of insult, all
sorts of injurious and opprobrious epithets, crying,
in a voice that trembled with rage and hatred:</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page267" id="page267"></a>[pg&nbsp;267]</span>
&quot;Thief, thief, wretch! What have you done with
your child, thief? Go, drunkard, vagabond, go drink
your liqueurs&mdash;and your child, perhaps, dying of
hunger! Reprobate, wolf, traitress, where is the
child? Where is the little angel? Where have you
hidden him, schemer? In such a hurry you were to
get rid of him so as to be left alone with your
trumpery young gentleman! Wolf, wolf&mdash;if I had
a gun, as sure as I am standing here, I would send a
charge of shot into you!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Leocadia, her face pale, her eyes red with weeping,
put out her hand to stop the mouth of the frenzied
old woman; but the latter caught her fingers
between her toothless gums, biting them and slavering
them with the foam of her fury, and when the
schoolmistress went upstairs, the old woman followed
her, crying after her in hoarse and sinister
accents:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You will never have the grace of God, wolf&mdash;God
and the Holy Virgin will punish you! Go, go,
rejoice now because you have carried out your evil
designs! May you be forever accursed, accursed,
accursed!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The malediction made Leocadia shudder. The
house, with Minguitos away, seemed like a tomb.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page268" id="page268"></a>[pg&nbsp;268]</span>
Flores had neither made the dinner nor lighted the
lamp. Leocadia, too sick at heart to do either,
threw herself on the bed, dressed as she was, and,
later on, undressed herself and went to bed without
tasting a morsel of food.</p>

<h2>XXV.</h2>

<p class="indent">With what interest did Segundo read the letters
of Roberto Blanquez giving him news of his book.
Roberto was a few years older than the Swan; the
difference in their ages was not so great as to prevent
their having been very good friends when they were at
college together, though it was great enough to have
given Blanquez so much more experience than the
poet as to enable him to serve as his guide and mentor.
Blanquez, too, had had his poetic epoch, when he
had written Galician verses; he now devoted himself
to the prose of a modest clerkship, and wrote official
articles. Madrid was enlightening him, and, with the
natural penetration of one in whose veins flowed Galician
blood, he was gradually acquiring a knowledge of
practical life. He entertained for Segundo a fanatic
admiration and a sincere attachment, one of those
college attachments which last a lifetime. Segundo
wrote to him with entire confidence&mdash;some cousins of
Blanquez were acquainted with the mother of Nieves
Mendez, and through this channel Segundo occasionally
received tidings of his lady-love. Blanquez
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page270" id="page270"></a>[pg&nbsp;270]</span>
was not ignorant of the episodes of the summer.
And in the beginning his news was very satisfactory:
&quot;Nieves lives in the greatest retirement&mdash;my cousins
have given me news of her. She scarcely ever leaves
the house except to go to mass. The child is not
well. The physicians say it is the age. They are
going to send her to a convent of the Sacred Heart
to be educated. They say the mother looks superb,
my boy. It seems they have been left very well off.
The book will soon appear now. Yesterday I chose
the paper for the edition and the linen paper for the
hundred copies <i>de luxe</i>. The type will be Elzevir,
which is at present the most fashionable. The title-page&mdash;they
make them beautiful now, in six colors&mdash;would
you like it to represent something fanciful,
something allegorical?&quot; In this style were Roberto&#39;s
letters, source of illusions for Segundo, sole food for
his imagination through all that long and gloomy
winter, in that out-of-the-way corner of the world,
in the midst of his prosaic domestic surroundings,
his mind filled with the recollections of his unhappy
passion.</p>

<p class="indent">March had arrived, that uncertain month of sunshine
and showers which heralds in the spring with
affluence of violets and primroses, when the cold
begins to lessen, and in the pale blue sky white
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page271" id="page271"></a>[pg&nbsp;271]</span>
clouds float like streamers, when Segundo received
that most precious of all objects, that object the
sight of which makes the heart palpitate with joy
and longing, mingled with an undefinable fear
resembling, somewhat, the feeling with which the
new-made father regards his first-born&mdash;his first
printed book. It seemed to him a dream that the
book should be there, before his eyes, in his hands,
with the satin-smooth white cover on which the
artist had gracefully twined around a group of pine
trees a few sprays of forget-me-nots; with its pea-green
paper, that gave it an antique air, the compositions
headed by three mysterious asterisks. Looking
at his verses thus, free from blots, finished and
correct, the thought standing out clearly in distinct
black characters on the delicately tinted page, he
almost felt as if they had issued from his brain just
as they were, smoothly flowing and with perfect
rhymes, without corrections or unmeaning syllables
put in to fill out the meter.</p>

<p class="indent">Leocadia was even more moved by the sight of
the book than its author had been. She shed tears
of joy. The fame of the poet was, in a sense, her
work! For two or three days she was happy, forgetting
the bad news which Flores brought her
every Sunday from Orense; from Orense, where
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page272" id="page272"></a>[pg&nbsp;272]</span>
Leocadia did not dare to go herself, fearing to yield
to the entreaties and melt before the prayers of the
child, but where palpitated those fibers of her heart
which still bled, and which Flores wrung with torture
by her account of the sufferings of Minguitos,
who declined visibly in health, and who always complained
that they made sport of him in the shop and
cast up his deformity to him.</p>

<p class="indent">Unsolvable mysteries of the human heart!
Segundo, who despised his native place, who believed&mdash;nor
was he mistaken&mdash;that there was not in
Vilamorta a single person capable of judging of the
merits of a poem, could not refrain from going one
evening to Saturnino Agonde&#39;s and drawing carelessly
the volume from his pocket, throwing it on
the counter and saying with affected indifference:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What do you think of that book, my boy?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">On the instant he repented of his weakness, so
many were the nonsensical remarks and absurd jokes
with which the beautiful volume inspired the irreverent
assemblage. He wished he had never shown
it. He had drawn all this upon himself. If the
public did not treat him better than his fellow-townsmen!
Man can never isolate himself completely
from his surroundings&mdash;the circle in which he moves
must always have an interest for him. However
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page273" id="page273"></a>[pg&nbsp;273]</span>
little importance Segundo might attach to the opinions
of the Vilamortans, and although their approbation
would assuredly not have raised him in his
own estimation, their stupid mockery wounded and
embittered his soul. He went home hurt and
pained. He spent a feverish night&mdash;one of those
nights in which great projects are conceived and
decisive resolutions adopted.</p>

<p class="indent">His resolutions and his plans he summed up in the
letter he wrote to Blanquez. The latter did not
answer by return of mail; days passed, and Segundo
went every morning to the post-office, always meeting
with the same laconic answer. At last one day
he received a voluminous registered letter.</p>


<hr class="hr2" />

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page274" id="page274"></a>[pg&nbsp;274]</span></p>

<h2>XXVI.</h2>

<p class="indent">As he opened it, several newspapers fell out, containing
notices marked by a cross of the volume of
poems just published, entitled &quot;Songs of Absence,&quot;
this being the name chosen by Segundo for his volume
of rhymes.</p>

<p class="indent">These were accompanied by a letter of four pages
from Roberto. What it might contain was of such
vital importance to Segundo, so great the influence
it might exercise over his future, that he laid it aside
fearing, he knew not why, to read it, wishing to defer
what he so eagerly desired. The letter lay open
before him and certain names, certain words frequently
repeated, caught his eye. The name of the
widowed Se&ntilde;ora de Comba was often mentioned in
it. To calm his agitation, which was purely nervous,
he took up the newspapers, resolving to read
first the marked paragraphs. He traversed the <i>via
crucis</i>, in the fullest signification of the words.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>El Imperial</i> gave a noisy boom to Galicia and, as a
proof that the country produced poets in the same
abundance as it produced exquisite peaches and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page275" id="page275"></a>[pg&nbsp;275]</span>
beautiful flowers mentioned, without naming him, the
author of &quot;Songs of Absence,&quot; a beautiful volume
just published. And not a line more, not a word of
criticism, nothing to indicate that anybody in the
office of the popular daily had taken the trouble
even to cut the leaves of the book. <i>El Liberal</i>, better
informed, declared, in three lines, that &quot;Songs
of Absence&quot; gave evidence of the author&#39;s great
facility in versification. <i>La Epoca</i>, in the most obscure
corner of its department, &quot;New Books,&quot; eulogized the
typographical elegance of the book; disapproved of
the romantic savor of the title and of the title-page,
and deplored in trenchant phrases that the poet
should have sought inspiration in the barren theme
of absence when there were so many wholesome,
cheerful and fruitful subjects on which to write.
<i>El Dia</i>&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">Ah, as for <i>El Dia</i>, it gave Segundo a castigation
in style: not one of those angry, predetermined, energetic
castigations, in which the lash is taken up with
both hands to crush a powerful and dangerous adversary,
but a contemptuous cut of the whip, a flick
with the nail, as it were, as one might brush away a
troublesome insect; one of those summary criticisms
in which the critic does not take the trouble to adduce
proof or argument in support of his criticisms,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page276" id="page276"></a>[pg&nbsp;276]</span>
whose justice he deems so evident as not to require
demonstration; an execution by a few jests, but
jests of a kind that extinguish a new author, crush
him, relegate him forever to the limbo of obscurity.
The critic said that now when verses of supreme
merit lacked readers it was greatly to be deplored
that the press should be made to groan with rhymes
of an inferior quality; that now when Becquer had
been placed in the pantheon of the immortals it was
a crime to treat him with the disrespect of stupidly
imitating him, mutilating and counterfeiting his best
thoughts; and finally, that it was to be regretted
that estimable young men, endowed, perhaps, with
admirable capabilities for trade, or for the career of
an apothecary or a notary, should spend their
parents&#39; money in costly editions of verses which no
one would either buy or read.</p>

<p class="indent">Underneath this philippic Roberto Blanquez had
written: &quot;Pay no attention to this ass. Read my
article.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">And indeed in an obscure, insignificant sheet, one
of those innumerable periodicals that see the light
in Madrid without Madrid ever seeing them, Blanquez
poured forth the gall of his wounded friendship
and patriotism&mdash;taking the critic to task, eulogizing
Segundo&#39;s book and declaring him the worthy compeer
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page277" id="page277"></a>[pg&nbsp;277]</span>
of Becquer, with the difference that the former
was a little sweeter, a little more dreamy, a little
more melancholy, as being the son of a land as beautiful
as it was unfortunate, and which was fairer than
Andalusia, than Switzerland, or than any other
country on the face of the globe; ending by saying
that if Becquer had been born in Galicia he would
feel, think, and write like <i>The Swan of Vilamorta</i>.</p>

<p class="indent">Segundo seized the bundle of newspapers and,
after looking at them for a moment fixedly and with
a gloomy brow, tore them into pieces, large at first,
then small, then smaller still, which he threw out of
the window to hover for a moment in the air like
butterflies or like the silvery petals of the flower of
illusion, and then fall into the nearest pool. Segundo
smiled bitterly. &quot;There goes fame,&quot; he said to himself.
&quot;Now I think I am calmer. Let us see what
the letter says.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Of this letter we need cite here only certain passages,
supplementing them with the comments made
on them in his mind by the reader.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;According to your request I went to the house
of Se&ntilde;ora de Comba to deliver to her the copy, so
carefully wrapped up and sealed, which you sent me
for that purpose.&quot;&mdash;Of course. It contained an inscription
which I did not want her to think that you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page278" id="page278"></a>[pg&nbsp;278]</span>
might have read.&mdash;&quot;She has a beautiful house, hangings
and natural flowers everywhere.&quot;&mdash;Everything
pertaining to her is like that, beautiful and refined.&mdash;&quot;But
I was obliged to return several times before
she would receive me, the moment was always inopportune.&quot;&mdash;She
does not receive indiscriminately all
who may chance to present themselves.&mdash;&quot;At last
she received me, after innumerable ceremonies and
formalities. She is very beautiful close by, more
beautiful, even, than at a distance, and it seems impossible
that she should have a daughter twelve
years old; she looks at most twenty-four or twenty-five.&quot;&mdash;What
news Roberto has to tell me.&mdash;&quot;The
moment I told her I had come on your part&quot;&mdash;Let
us hear&mdash;&quot;she became&mdash;what shall I say?&quot;&mdash;red&mdash;&quot;displeased
and annoyed, my boy, and in addition so
serious, that I was quite taken aback, and did not
know what to do.&quot;&mdash;Infamous! Infamous!&mdash;&quot;She
was afraid that I&quot;&mdash;Let us hear; let us finish, let us
finish.&mdash;&quot;She refused to receive the book, in spite
of my urgent entreaties&quot;&mdash;but this is inconceivable.
Ah, what a woman!&mdash;&quot;because she says it would remind
her too forcibly of that place and of the death
of her husband, whom God keep in his glory; and
consequently she begs you to excuse her&quot;&mdash;wretch!&mdash;&quot;from
opening the package and reading
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page279" id="page279"></a>[pg&nbsp;279]</span>
your verse, for which she thanks you.&quot;&mdash;Ha! ha!
ha!&mdash;Bravo! What an actress!</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Notwithstanding all this, as you had charged me
explicitly to deliver it to her, I determined not to
take the book back with me and, taking up my hat
and saluting her, I laid your package on a table. On
the following morning, however, it came back to me
unopened, with all its seals intact.&quot;&mdash;And I did not
throw her into the Avieiro that day when our
lips&mdash;the more fool I! Well, let us finish.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;In view of the little widow&#39;s conduct I imagine
that you must have invented all that about the window
and the precipice; you must have told it to me
to fool me or, as you are so imaginative, you dreamed
that it happened and you took the dream for reality.&quot;&mdash;He
does well to mock me.&mdash;&quot;At all events,
my boy, if you were interested in the widow, think
no more about her. I know to a certainty, through
my cousins, who have it for a fact from their father,
that at the expiration of the period of her mourning
she is to marry a certain Marquis de Cameros who
represented at one time a district in Lugo.&quot;&mdash;Yes,
yes, I understand.&mdash;&quot;The thing is serious, for, according
to what my cousins say, the house linen is being
embroidered already with the coronet of a marchioness.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page280" id="page280"></a>[pg&nbsp;280]</span>
The letter was torn still more slowly and into
still smaller pieces than the newspapers. With
the fragments Segundo made a ball which he
threw far into the middle of the pool. &quot;Such is
love,&quot; he said to himself, laughing bitterly.</p>

<p class="indent">He began to walk up and down the room, at first
with a certain monotonous regularity, then restlessly
and with fury. Clara, the eldest of his sisters, half
opened the door of the room, saying:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Aunt Gáspara says you are to come.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What for?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Dinner is ready.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Segundo took his hat and rushing into the street
walked toward the river, filled with that species of
fury which one who has just received some mental
shock, some bitter disappointment, is apt to feel at
being called on to take part in any of the ordinary
concerns of life.</p>


<hr class="hr2" />

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page281" id="page281"></a>[pg&nbsp;281]</span></p>

<h2>XXVII.</h2>

<p class="indent">What a walk was his along the marshy borders of
the Avieiro! At times he hurried on without any
motive for accelerating his steps, and again, equally
without motive, stood still, his gaze riveted on some
object but in reality seeing nothing. One regret,
a gnawing grief, pierced his soul when he recalled
the past. As in a shipwreck there is for each of the
passengers some one particular object whose loss he
deplores more bitterly than that of all his other possessions,
so Segundo, of all his past life, regretted
one instant above every other, an instant which he
would have given all he possessed to live over
again&mdash;that during which he had stood with Nieves
on the edge of the precipice, when he might have
obtained a worthy and glorious death, carrying with
him into the abyss the precious treasure of his illusions,
and the form of the woman who for that one
unforgettable instant only, had truly loved him.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;A coward then, and a coward now!&quot; thought
the poet, calling all his resolution to his aid but finding
himself unable to summon the necessary courage
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page282" id="page282"></a>[pg&nbsp;282]</span>
to throw himself at once into the cold and muddy
waters of the river. What moments of anguish!
Giddy with suffering he seated himself on a stone
on the river bank and watched with idiotic vacancy
of expression the circles formed on the bosom of the
river by the drops of rain that fell slantingly from
the gray sky, as they expanded and were lost in
other circles that pressed upon them on all sides,
while new circles took their place, to be lost in their
turn in yet other circles, covering the surface of the
water with a wavy design resembling the silver work
called <i>guilloch&eacute;</i>. The poet did not even notice that
these same rain-drops that fell thick and fast on the
surface of the Avieiro fell also on his hat and shoulders,
ran down his forehead and, making their way
between his collar and his skin, trickled down his
neck. He noticed it only when the chill they produced
made him shiver and he rose and walked
slowly home, where dinner was already over and no
one thought of offering him even so much as a cup
of broth.</p>

<p class="indent">Two or three days later a fever declared itself,
which was at first slight, but soon grew serious.
Tropiezo called it a gastric and catarrhal fever,
and truth compels us to say that he administered
remedies not altogether inappropriate; gastric
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page283" id="page283"></a>[pg&nbsp;283]</span>
and catarrhal fevers are, for physicians whose
knowledge is derived chiefly from experience,
a perfect boon from Heaven, a glorious field
in which they may count every battle a victory;
a beaten path in which they run no risk of
going astray. It will not lead them to the unknown
pole of science, but at least it will betray them into
no abyss.</p>

<p class="indent">As Tropiezo was leaving García&#39;s house one evening,
after his customary visit to Segundo, muffled up
to the ears in his comforter, he saw, standing beside
the lawyer&#39;s door in the shadow cast by the contiguous
wall, a woman clad in an old morning gown
and with her head bare. The night was bright and
Don Fermin was able to distinguish her features,
but it was not without some difficulty that he recognized
her to be Leocadia, so altered and aged did
the poor schoolmistress look. Her countenance betrayed
the keenest anxiety as she asked the doctor:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And what news, Don Fermin? How is Segundo
getting on?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ah, good evening, Leocadia. Do you know that
at first I did not recognize you?&mdash;Well, very well;
there is no cause for uneasiness. To-day I ordered
him some of the <i>puchero</i> and some soup. It was
nothing&mdash;a cold caught by getting a wetting. But
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page284" id="page284"></a>[pg&nbsp;284]</span>
the boy seems a little preoccupied, and he was for a
time so sad and dejected that I thought he was
never going to get back his appetite. At this season
it is necessary to go warmly clad; we have a
fine day, and then, when you least expect it, back
come the rain and the cold again. And you&mdash;how
are you getting on? They tell me that you have
not been well, either. You must take care of yourself.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There is nothing the matter with me, Don Fermin.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;So much the better. Any news of the boy?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He is in Orense, poor child. He can&#39;t get used
to it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He will get used to it by and by. Of course&mdash;accustomed
to be petted. Well, Leocadia, good-night.
Go home, my dear woman, go home.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Don Fermin proceeded on his way, drawing his
comforter up closer around his ears. That woman
was mad; she had not taken the disease lightly, it
seemed. And how altered she was! How old she
had grown in these last few months! Old women
were worse than young girls when they fell in love.
He had done wisely, very wisely in telling her nothing
about Segundo&#39;s new plans. She was capable
of tearing down the house if he had told her. No,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page285" id="page285"></a>[pg&nbsp;285]</span>
silence, silence. A shut mouth catches no flies. Let
her find it out through someone else besides him.
And with these sensible ideas and worthy intentions
Tropiezo reached Agonde&#39;s, and before a quarter of
an hour had elapsed unbosomed himself of his news:
Segundo Garc&iacute;a was going to America to seek his
fortune&mdash;as soon as he should be entirely well, of
course. He would take the steamer at Corunna.</p>

<p class="indent">The occasion was a favorable one for the company
to lament once more in concert the death of Don
Victoriano Andres de la Comba, protector and father
of all the Vilamortans in want of situations, a useful
representative and an untiring worker for the district.
If he were alive now most assuredly a young
man of so much ability&mdash;a poet&mdash;that night the party
all agreed that Segundo had ability and was a poet&mdash;would
not be obliged to go across the raging seas in
quest of a decent situation. But since they had lost
Don Victoriano, Vilamorta was without a voice in
the regions of influence and favor, for Se&ntilde;orito de
Romero, the present representative of the district,
belonged to the class of docile representatives who
give no trouble to the Government, who vote when
their votes are wanted, and who hold themselves
cheap, valuing themselves at no more than a few
tobacco shops, and half a dozen or so of official
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page286" id="page286"></a>[pg&nbsp;286]</span>
appointments. Agonde took his revenge that night,
expatiating on his favorite theme, and abusing the
pernicious Eufrasian influence which was responsible
for the decadence of Vilamorta, on account of
which its youth were obliged to emigrate to the New
World. The apothecary expounded his theories&mdash;he
liked the representative of a district to show himself
in it occasionally. Otherwise of what use was
he? In his eyes the ideal representative was that
famous politician from whom the barber of the town
he represented had asked a place, basing his request
on the fact that, owing to the distribution of appointments
among the persons of his station in the
town, there were no customers left for him to shave
and he was starving. The Alcalde here interposed,
saying that he had it on very good authority that
Se&ntilde;orito de Romero intended to interest himself in
earnest for Vilamorta; the confectioner and some
others of those present confirmed this statement, and
then arose a discussion in which it was proved beyond
a doubt that a dead representative has no
friends and that the new representative of the district
had already, in the very stronghold of the former
Combista radicals, friends and adherents.</p>

<h2>XXVIII.</h2>

<p class="indent">The Swan has left his native lake, or rather, his
pool; he has crossed the Atlantic on the wings of
steam. Will he ever return? Will he come back
with a sallow countenance, a disordered liver, and
some thousands of dollars, in bills of exchange, in
his pocketbook, to end his life where it began, as
the ship disabled by storms receives its last repairs
in the dockyard in which it was built? Will the
black vomit, that terrible malady of the Antilles, the
scourge of the Iberians who seek to emulate Columbus
conquering a new world, attack him on his
arrival on the young continent? Will he remain in
the tropics, riding in his carriage, united in the bonds
of matrimony to some Creole? Will he preside one
day over one of those diminutive republics, in which
the doctors are generals and the generals doctors?
Will his melancholy be cured by the salty kiss of
the ocean breeze, by the contact of virgin soil, the
sharp spur of necessity, that, pushing him into the
conflict, will say to him, &quot;Work&quot;?</p>

<p class="indent">History may perhaps at some future day relate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page288" id="page288"></a>[pg&nbsp;288]</span>
the story of the metamorphosis of the Swan, of his
wanderings and his vicissitudes; but years must first
elapse, for it was only yesterday, as one might say,
that Segundo Garc&iacute;a quitted Vilamorta, leaving the
schoolmistress behind him dissolved in tears. And
the story of the schoolmistress is the only episode
in the chronicle of the Swan which we can at present
bring to an end.</p>

<p class="indent">Leocadia was the theme of much gossip in Vilamorta.
She was seriously ill, according to some, according
to others, ruined, and according to many,
touched in her mind. She had been seen haunting the
neighborhood of Segundo&#39;s house on various nights
during the poet&#39;s illness; it was affirmed that she had
sold her land and that her house was mortgaged to
Clodio Genday; but the strangest thing of all, that
which was most bitterly censured, was her neglect of
her son after having cared for him and watched over
him from his infancy, never going to Orense to see
him, while old Flores went there constantly, bringing
back worse and worse news of the child every time she
went&mdash;that he was wasting away, that he spit blood,
that he was dying of grief, that he would not last a
month. Leocadia, as she listened, would let her
chin fall upon her breast, and at times her shoulders
would move convulsively, as if she were weeping.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page289" id="page289"></a>[pg&nbsp;289]</span>
Otherwise she appeared calm, although she was very
silent and had lost her former activity. She helped
Flores in the kitchen, attended to the children of
the school, swept and dusted&mdash;all like an automaton,
while Flores, who pitilessly spied out every occasion
to find fault with her, took pleasure in crying:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Woman, you have left this side of the pan dirty&mdash;woman,
you haven&#39;t mended your skirt&mdash;woman,
what are you thinking about? I am going to Orense
to-day and you will have to take care of the <i>puchero</i>.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">At the end of the summer Clodio demanded the
interest on his loan and Leocadia was unable to pay
it; she was notified accordingly that, after the necessary
legal proceedings, the creditor would avail himself
of his legal right to take possession of the house.
This was a terrible blow for Leocadia.</p>

<p class="indent">It will sometimes happen that a prisoner, a distinguished
personage, a king, it may be, shut up
through an adverse fate within the walls of a dungeon,
stripped of his grandeur, deprived of all that
once constituted his happiness, will bear his ills for
years with resignation, calm in appearance although
dejected, but if some day, by the cruel tyranny of
his jailors, this prisoner is deprived of some bauble,
some trifling object for which he had conceived an
affection, the grief pent up within his bosom will
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page290" id="page290"></a>[pg&nbsp;290]</span>
burst its bounds, and the wildest manifestations of
grief will follow. Something like this happened to
Leocadia when she learned that she must abandon
forever the beloved little house where she had spent
in Segundo&#39;s company hours unique in her existence;
the little house in which she was mistress, which had
been rebuilt with her savings, the little house lately
so neat and so attractive, of which she was so proud.</p>

<p class="indent">Flores heard her on several nights sobbing loudly,
but when on one or two occasions, moved by an involuntary
feeling of pity, the old woman went into
her room to ask her what ailed her, if she could do
anything for her, Leocadia, covering her face with
the bedclothes, had answered in a dull voice: &quot;There
is nothing the matter with me, woman; let me sleep.
You will not even let me sleep!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">During those days her moods varied constantly
and she formed a thousand different plans. She
talked of going to live in Orense, of giving up the
school and taking sewing to do in the house; she
talked, too, of accepting the proposal of Clodio Genday,
who, having dismissed his young servant, for
what reason no one knew, offered to take Leocadia
as his housekeeper, by which arrangement she would
remain in her house, Flores, of course, being dismissed.
None of these plans lasted for more than
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page291" id="page291"></a>[pg&nbsp;291]</span>
a very short time, but were all in turn rejected to
give place to others no less ephemeral; and while
the schoolmistress was thus engaged in forming and
rejecting plans the time was fast approaching
when she should find herself without a shelter.</p>

<p class="indent">One market day Leocadia went to purchase
various articles urgently needed by Flores, among
others a sieve and a new chocolate-pot, the old one
being no longer fit for use. The movement of the
crowd, the jostling of the hucksters, and the glare of
the autumnal sun made her head, weak from want
of sleep, from fasting, and from suffering&mdash;slightly
dizzy. She stopped before a stall where sieves
were sold, a sort of variety booth, where innumerable
indispensable trifles were for sale&mdash;chocolate-beaters,
frying-pans, saucepans, kerosene lamps. In a corner
were two articles of merchandise in great request in
the place&mdash;consisting of pink paper, soft, like brown
paper, and some whitish powder, resembling spoiled
flour. Leocadia&#39;s glance fell on these, and the vender,
thinking she wished to buy some, began to extol
their properties, explaining that the pink sheets
moistened and placed on a plate, would not leave
a fly alive in the neighborhood, and that the white
powder was <i>seneca</i>, for killing mice, the manner of
using it being to mix it well with cheese and place
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page292" id="page292"></a>[pg&nbsp;292]</span>
the mixture, made into little balls, in their haunts.
Leocadia asked the price and told the vender to
give her a small quantity, and the woman, to appear
generous, took up a good portion on the spatula,
wrapped it up in paper, and gave it to her for a
trifling sum. The drug indeed was of little value,
being very common in that part of the country,
where native arsenic abounds in the calcareous spar
forming one of the banks of the Avieiro, and arsenic,
acid&mdash;rat-poison&mdash;is sold openly in the fairs, rather
than in drug shops. The schoolmistress put away
the powder, bought, through complaisance, half a
dozen of the pink slips of paper, and on her return
home punctually delivered to Flores the articles she
had been commissioned to purchase.</p>

<p class="indent">Flores noticed that after dinner Leocadia shut
herself up in her bedroom, where the old woman
could hear her talking aloud as if she were praying.
Accustomed to her eccentricities the servant thought
nothing about the matter. When she had ended
her prayer, the schoolmistress stepped out on the
balcony, where she stood gazing for a long time at
the flower-pots; she then went into the parlor and
looked for a good while also at the sofa, the chairs,
the little table, the spots which reminded her of the
past. Then she went into the kitchen. Flores
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page293" id="page293"></a>[pg&nbsp;293]</span>
declared afterward&mdash;but in such cases who is there
that does not lay claim to a prophetic instinct&mdash;that
Leocadia&#39;s manner on entering had attracted her attention.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Have you any fresh water?&quot; she asked.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Give me a glass of it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Flores affirmed that, as she took the glass, the
hand of the schoolmistress trembled, as if she had a
chill, and the strangest part of the matter was that,
although there was no sugar in the water, Leocadia
asked for a spoon, which she put into the glass. An
hour, or perhaps an hour and a half passed, when
Flores heard Leocadia groan. She hurried to her
room and saw her lying on the bed, her face frightfully
pale, making desperate and fruitless efforts to
vomit. Then a cold perspiration broke out on the
forehead of the sick woman, and she remained motionless
and speechless. Flores, terrified, ran for
Don Fermin, urging him to hurry, saying this was
no jesting matter. When Don Fermin arrived out
of breath, he asked:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What is this, Leocadia? What is the matter
with you; my dear woman, what is the matter with
you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Opening her dilated eyes, she murmured:</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page294" id="page294"></a>[pg&nbsp;294]</span>
&quot;Nothing, Don Fermin, nothing.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Standing on the table at the head of the bed was
the glass; it contained no water, but the bottom and
the sides of the vessel were coated with a white
powder which had remained undissolved and which
the schoolmistress, not wishing to leave it there, had
scraped off in places with the spoon. It is proper to
say, on this occasion also, that the illustrious Tropiezo
made no mistake in the treatment of so simple
a case. Tropiezo had already fought some battles
with this common toxic substance and knew its
tricks; he had recourse, without a moment&#39;s delay,
to the use of powerful emetics and of oil. Only
the poison, having gained the start of him, had already
entered into the circulation and ran through the
veins of the schoolmistress, chilling her blood.
When the nausea and the vomiting ceased several
little red spots&mdash;an eruption similar to that of scarlet-fever&mdash;made
their appearance on Leocadia&#39;s
pallid face. This symptom lasted until death came
to set her sad spirit free and release it from its sufferings,
which was toward daybreak. Shortly before
her death, during an interval of freedom from pain,
Leocadia, making a sign to Flores to come nearer,
whispered in her ear: &quot;Promise me&mdash;that the child
shall not know it&mdash;by the soul of your mother&mdash;don&#39;t
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page295" id="page295"></a>[pg&nbsp;295]</span>
tell him&mdash;don&#39;t tell him the manner of my
death.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">A few days later Tropiezo was defending himself
to the party at Agonde&#39;s who, for the pleasure
of making him angry, were accusing him of
being responsible for the death of the schoolmistress.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;For one thing, they called me too late, much too
late,&quot; he said; &quot;when the woman was almost in her
death agony. For another, she had taken a quantity
of arsenic which was not large enough to produce
vomiting, but which was too small to cause
merely a colic and be done with it. Where I made
the mistake was in waiting so long before sending
for the priest. I did it with the best intentions, so
as not to frighten her and hoping we might yet pull
her through. When extreme unction was administered
she had no senses left to know what was going
on.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;So that,&quot; said Agonde maliciously, &quot;where you
are called in, either the soul or the body is sure to
meet with a trip.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The company applauded the joke, and there followed
funereal jests mingled with expressions of
pity. Clodio Genday, the creditor of the deceased,
moved about uneasily in his chair. What stupid
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page296" id="page296"></a>[pg&nbsp;296]</span>
conversation, <i>canario</i>! Let them talk of more cheerful
subjects!</p>

<p class="indent">And they talked of very cheerful and satisfactory
subjects indeed. Se&ntilde;orito de Romero had promised
to put a telegraph-office in Vilamorta; and the
newspapers were saying that, owing to the increasing
importance of the viticultural interests of the
Border, a branch railroad was needed for which the
engineers were soon coming to survey the ground.</p>

<p class="indent">This is the story that has attracted such wide attention while
running through the <i>Century Magazine</i>. There has been no such
picture of New York social life painted within the memory of the
present generation. The satire is as keen as a rapier point, while the
story itself has its marked pathetic side. Never has the subject of
Anglomania been so cleverly treated as in these pages, and it is not
to be wondered at that society is deeply agitated as to the authorship
of a story which touches it in its most vulnerable part.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">&quot;This delicious satire from the pungent pen of an anonymous writer
must be read to be appreciated. From the introduction on board the
Etruria to the final, when the heroine waves adieu to her English Lord, it
is life, real, true American life, and we blush at the truth of the picture.
There is no line not replete with scathing sarcasm, no character which we
have not seen and known.... Read this book and see human nature;

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org/license

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
